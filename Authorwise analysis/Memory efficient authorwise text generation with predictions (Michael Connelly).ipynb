left the office\n"," with the man working with the light. he had the\n"," same new angle on the side of the desk. he\n"," was there and then started to sit down on the\n"," table. bosch tried to take his office. “i don’t care\n"," what i could do with the way to talk to\n"," him and he doesn’t know how it is. i’ll have\n"," to see what i can do and i want to\n"," get to work and i have to get to the\n"," car. i don't know what you are doing it doing?”\n"," bosch looked at the men as his eyes were in\n"," the past the back to the office. he had no\n"," idea how he would know what he had in the\n"," same position as he had seen the photo of a\n"," position on the front of the house. the one was\n"," a room was a large on the bed and saw\n"," a man in a large holding room at the time\n"," of the man who had been in the case was\n"," in the years before. the one was in court. it\n"," was no one about the case in the station and\n"," a guy she had been in the last week of\n"," a split

reached\n"," over to his chest. “i don’t want to talk to\n"," you, you can please be in a dead or that\n"," you have her life in the room, then i could\n"," see you when i got a fresh of it with\n"," a set of the own phone and then went back\n"," to the table. i have to think that i could\n"," make that be it in a half hour to the\n"," back of the statement and he was sure it was\n"," the end of a business under the life as well\n"," as a mistake. and i'm not going to have a\n"," few days to see if he needed to get out\n"," of there, then with the two more questions else about\n"," it but then i probably wanted to get back to\n"," the malibu and so he could have a cop to\n"," work with the other and the short file of his\n"," head. then he realized he had a lawyer, but he\n"," didn't answer. he was gone at the door, and bosch\n"," called the station. it was a good time to be\n"," able to save the door. “you had to see if\n"," i was a lot of money for the case, i\n"," was going to see the guy who had made it\n"," up to the jury. he had a spread on the\n"," wall of the stack of files and the small table\n"," was been left in the the the front desk and\n"," they were going to

step on to\n"," the bathroom. the door was open. i need to ask\n"," him the other time that he has an case people\n"," were working on the floor and we got their attention\n"," to the jury to get to the best to be\n"," the witness who was going to get the chance to\n"," go out of the courtroom for a grand jury to\n"," try to be in the motion to be a judge\n"," so i could get back to him. i didn’t want\n"," to get out of the way. i was going to\n"," get out of the box and i could see that\n"," of my name one of my client was in the\n"," courtroom and the judge asked him to get in the\n"," moment with this monday morning to make sure that the\n"," man had not been a little too long. bosch could\n"," see it was a hallway and i was sitting in\n"," a car. i sat in a chair next to the\n","

want to tell you the man who was there. i\n"," want to go back to the office that i can\n"," go to the city. i got my guy out of\n"," my car and i put the down on the other\n"," side of the table. she looked at the jury back\n"," in the prosecution and then i got to the middle\n"," of the car and checked the other at the camera\n"," and then walked back to the front door of the\n"," courtroom. he took the phone and looked at the screen\n"," and nodded. he was still a shot on his face\n"," and he was already standing in the hallway. this was\n"," lying back, the door was open and jessup stepped back\n"," into the room. he was a cop. the man looked\n"," at them and said, i wasn’t sure what i was\n"," going to say about the murder of how he was\n"," giving me a client and a new piece of paper\n"," and i wanted to go out and let him see\n"," it again. he was about to make sure it was\n"," a long secret was not the one of the crime.\n"," it was a long time before i could get the\n"," weapon off the call. i looked at my watch. i\n"," was ready to see it with the cell and when\n"," he was sitting in front of the lab on the\n"," side of the fire testify to the had been made\n"," in the middle of the house and the man he\n"," had used his name to the phone. he had to\n"," look at the place at the end of the lot.\n"," and that was the white same thing and i told\n"," him to have been a little bit and i could\n"," get it from the house. i was just a private\n"," office and he was a little while ago and bosch\n"," had been and edgar had taken it to the end\n"," of the case. he looked at the media and they\n"," looked at the wall that was was in the seat\n"," with the bed with the empty box into the mirror.\n"," she was not sitting in the hallway and headed toward\n"," the door. bosch got up and headed toward the parking\n"," lot, then he heard the sound of the door after\n"," the interview room was not a little bit before while\n"," he was in the lab but he was a dead\n"," call or to be looking at her. she would be\n"," an appointment with a reporter to make sure you know\n"," what it was the problem with this woman and tell\n"," him he had never gotten in the next time but\n"," he had to be working on the camera with a\n"," package and it. the man he was able to just\n"," leave it all over the computer and go to write\n"," a quick or the front of the doors to the\n"," station from the house. the two of them was a\n"," place that was a missing newspaper in the place where\n"," she was the only one who was wearing a black\n"," dress but there was no one in the pass. they\n"," found a few minutes when she got up and walked\n"," into the room and the man was working with the\n"," other two women who had been a contents of a\n"," decision to the next the room and the wall was\n"," open at the end of the desk. he was going\n"," to be looking and into the garage. he grabbed the\n"," two shots and took the shot at the position in\n"," the box. i went through the window and looked at\n"," the monitor and after that, bosch had been in the\n"," front and right the detective bureau. he looked at the\n"," photo he had been over and i saw it was\n"," a bad still know of that that it was just\n"," a early and the next day in the lot is\n"," a damn good prosecutor in the this trial. i got\n"," back to the case and then i could do it.\n"," i didn’t know how the judge went on the desk\n"," and i saw the word i was just getting the\n"," plant and i said i was going to be able\n"," to go to the office. it was a good break\n"," and i could be able to get the court a\n"," few days to make sure they said that he had\n"," been a little bit and not a movie that had\n"," been sent from the office and i told him to\n"," make sure i was going to see the case?” bosch\n"," turned to the two men and of the money and\n"," the one was in the surveillance in the middle of\n"," the house on the way he was going to have\n"," the same thing as he had to know what he\n"," had to do. he was not sure he was too\n"," much. he was going to be in a step to\n"," see if he was going to let it go to\n"," a movie he was then out of the corner and\n"," the top was in a room i had seen in\n"," an old man. he had the phone number to the\n"," closet of the prison was going to look at the\n"," photo of her as he was just the second set\n"," of the fbi and the man in the first place.\n"," he had a few minutes and his partner was in\n"," the car and called the number for the guy who\n"," had made it to be a long time ago. i\n"," have to ask me that i do a story that\n"," i can get the attention of a woman who was\n"," on the door she had seen me. i was right\n"," and was going to go out and i get the\n"," chance to stay with the phone i was on the\n"," line. as soon as i do it to get out\n"," of there and get my best back on the list\n"," i believe that i would be right. that was the\n"," one i had said to the name of the investigation\n"," of the search warrant or a law enforcement forty in\n"," the first of the of the fbi was the in\n"," the back of the van and the next one was\n"," open. he took the photo back to the desk where\n"," he had seen the second day and the mercedes was\n"," a small corner with a man with the crowd and\n"," the other parking lot at the end of the house\n"," and then went into the office. he had a small\n"," enough time to see if he had a name and\n"," a few had to be a girl. he was not\n"," on the fire was a long time before answering. “i\n"," want to get a feel like i was the one\n"," who could get the money. “what is it?” i asked.\n"," i just said it was a good job. you know,\n"," i don’t know. but i want to get back to\n"," my house and get this thing in the back of\n"," the space for a while the lapd and he had\n"," been sent to the murders and it was a series\n"," of a handle when he was the house had been\n"," so he could see the name of the conversation and\n"," he had to have a few

to the fbi had\n"," been stopped in the list of the request for the\n"," lead to the other time in the story on the\n"," boat would be a good day to get a better\n"," box to work at it. but i think i want\n"," to see what i was doing but i didn’t want\n"," to pay out to the house and go to the\n"," scene. we have all of the tape with him to\n"," go to the door. he then used his hand up\n"," to the inside the front of his neck and the\n"," other door went to the killing of us. he was\n"," going to have the gun for the private right and\n"," he could see the safe. he had been found in\n"," a book

if\n"," i had to do on the same way. i was\n"," one of the high on the way in the day\n"," and i had to see the case in the world.\n"," the same time bosch had never been a friend. at\n"," the time he found his name on the floor and\n"," the knife and he walked back into the room. the\n"," pay street for a few minutes later and then the\n"," man was standing on the floor where he had been\n"," able to get to the second with a case or\n"," a day of a mission of place. he was going\n"," to go to the who was the man who was\n"," going to be the only one who was working at\n"," the other may not be any one in the the\n"," murder correct?” “that is the way to work on the\n"," case?” “yes, he said, “the number he has been killed\n"," and then i have to make a call. it is\n"," a nice start to go into my room to the\n"," minutes.” “doesn’t make a few hours and ask if that’s\n"," not what we are doing is that the chief wasn’t\n"," going to be able to get to the chance to\n"," save the witness on the car. i look at the\n"," defense table with a few pages of in the box\n"," and looked at her. “i can’t help you, mr. haller.”\n"," i nodded. i don’t have any of your client and\n"," that has been so i can get a good look\n"," at the cars and the woman who didn’t see those\n"," back and then looked at the two other files in\n"," a white story that made a mistake. so i could\n"," say they were the only one of the water on\n"," the other side of the table for a few moments\n"," and then bosch got down the front door of the\n"," bedroom. he took his hand up to the bottom of\n"," the bed. he was sitting in the car and the\n"," door was open. the man of the door was on\n"," the floor and he remembered the light in the room\n"," and the wall of the cardboard box had been pretty\n"," clear but i didn’t know that the name was the\n"," real answer to open a bullet and let it go.\n"," i then used the girl to my side and i\n"," could say the next one was the one who would\n"," have been the whole thing to pass to the defense\n"," and then i was still in the car. i decided\n"," to be on the screen and i put it down\n"," on my desk to make sure i should do know\n"," what you want. i knew you the guy who had\n"," to do that, this is a long time ago or\n"," the bureau was blood on the list. it was an\n"," old man. bosch looked at the two drawers of the\n"," business and then it was a little bit but they\n"," had to be a second two more than the first\n"," time i had been given court before. i knew the\n"," story was a long time and i was standing in\n"," the kitchen room and saw a murder. he was sure\n"," he had to bury it during which the story was\n"," a book that had been asked me to do it\n"," the way i had to get to the office and\n"," be with the victim in the

to the defense or to go to\n"," the station and the judge of judge call me on\n"," the bench and she hung up. the bureau was in\n"," the room and back the other car on the table.\n"," it was the same time was not a suspect in\n"," a private office and the other same time i can\n"," find a few more than those i have to do\n"," the story to see if you are going to come\n"," back to the office a few more time.” bosch looked\n"," at the man who had put the back in the\n"," message. he was still sure he was going to talk\n"," to him but he was in the last morning and\n"," he would be about to talk about the city of\n"," the other than the death of a murder in a\n"," homicide officer of a pain that was the other thing.\n"," it was a long shot and that i was going\n"," to come down from the house. i took out the\n"," car and got out the door and then took the\n"," step through the door. he pulled the way back to\n"," the corner of the office and stepped over the wall\n"," to the table. the door was the small man who\n"," had been a little bit and the other way he\n"," had to make a motion of his shirt. his voice\n"," was out of a home. he turned and started the\n"," car and walked out of the water. he turned back\n"," to the door and walked on to the door. he\n"," noticed that the light came up from the back of\n"," the computer and began to read it. it was a\n"," lot of a good and that he was in the\n"," next time to his next mother on the second floor\n"," of the bed and the doors was open and the\n"," one was in the back of the car. the man\n"," were there and i was going to get the sound\n"," up to the other side of the tunnel to go\n"," back to the parking lot when he was the kind\n"," of standing in front of him. he was the car.\n"," bosch was looking but he wasn't going to say anything.\n"," he was already sure he had the windshield on the\n"," screen and i was parked on the front of the\n"," desk. i got out of the courtroom and got a\n"," few number. i want to take the chair out of\n"," the corner of the room to see if he had\n"," been working the tape to the other day of the\n"," investigation to the house on the boat was in the\n"," car and found the file notes on the front and\n"," sat my my hand. i was feeling of her but\n"," i wanted to put him in the first place. there\n"," was a hallway on the table in the front of\n"," the house. in the room he had to go to\n"," a set of phone call a thorough and the judge\n"," answered right to the bench where she was smiling and\n"," in the room table. she walked out to the railing\n"," and started she went to the car. she was going\n"," to let me go to the house on the bench\n"," next to the left for the jury to go to\n"," the defense and i didn't talk to me. i said\n"," that the place was that you are in the witness\n"," room, the man who called the jury with the last\n"," reason to do his dead. he was going to tell\n"," me what he was trying to say but it was\n"," an old man who went to the the door. they\n"," were looking for the man who was in the room\n"," and saw a man in a row of eyes led\n"," to a man who had met her as a young\n"," man in the machine on the other side of the\n"," table. bosch could tell he was a dead man in\n"," the room. he had to be the only one of\n"," the reports or a young man in a newspaper in\n"," the dark and then the rest of the office was\n"," the other time in the first place. there was a\n"," white car in the room and pulled the second with\n"," the top of the whole file and which he had\n"," not been in the first case of the death of\n"," the investigation and then they were in one of the\n"," cars. the man he was going to say he was\n"," standing in a box. it was someone who would be\n"," to the other interview. he decided that he would be\n"," a little bit. he was gone through the murder that\n"," the two men were on the bed. he was very\n"," good. he would have a few moments and i realized\n"," i was finally ready to go out to my office\n"," on the screen and i had to go in the\n"," car. i then put it on the blue and i\n"," could see it was empty from the room i had\n"," an answer to let him ask all of the information\n"," on the thing and then that would be a few\n"," minutes ago. i had to have a file on the\n"," wall and i had nothing to do with the parking\n"," lot in the bedroom and i was just as much\n"," the next time she was in the room and the\n"," card was in the car. they found the magazine if\n"," it was the trust in the photo to its work.\n"," the door was closed. bosch had the stack of things\n"," with the search of the other files over the night\n"," he had to talk to him and he couldn’t see\n"," the line with the next day. the woman he had\n"," lied to the homicide from his case at the end\n"," of him and he was still in a few minutes\n"," before he could see the light of the room to\n"," the railing and called the wall had been found in\n"," the bedroom. the next day of it was all the\n"," way to do the same way to be a long\n"," week and i asked to be the person in the\n"," way to the lot of the prosecution and i knew\n"," what they had to do. i was just trying to\n"," make a good set of somebody to think about the\n"," current case. we were dead but i didn’t know what\n"," i knew about something in the file in the courtroom\n"," that time he used to read the next week or\n"," the one who had left the house on his face\n"," and the clerk was in the back of the car.\n"," i didn’t have a lot of things i did about\n"," the interest of the case. he tried to bring the\n"," light back onto the bed. he looked at the refrigerator\n"," and raised his arms. the two air was in the\n"," room, his eyes were on the floor and a large\n"," white body and pulled it out onto the floor. it\n"," had been checked the number for an hour first. he\n"," had the light back on the sidewalk and they had\n"," to get a view of their you?� he stopped in\n"," the house. he was still sure he was the lights\n"," in the room. he checked her his eyes and then\n"," walked back to the angle of the yard at the\n"," next two of the black evidence — the case is\n"," to go to the end of the list and the\n"," case is to the case. i am not going to\n"," be able to pick it up on the phone, his\n"," face was like a little nearby moved and the elevator\n"," walked down the hall to the front door. he stepped\n"," out and saw the girl without a tape to make\n"," sure i was being the one who had heard some\n"," of the light on the bed. he looked at it.\n"," he had the captain but he knew it was one\n"," of those two hours before he could see the well\n"," of the room and the first time i had said\n"," that i was a fresh call from my attorney were\n"," going to ten rings in the lab. i have to\n"," sit up in the office and get into the lab\n"," and the next thing was about the rest of the\n"," car and back to the office and the had been\n"," shot to the right. that was the case that was\n"," in the corner. as the judge got up and tried\n"," to pull the to a judge. he followed the room\n"," down the hallway and into the car. the two happened.\n"," he jumped up and moved back to the new apartment\n"," and pushed the key out to the hallway to the\n"," door. he turned and looked at the mirror and saw\n"," the man in his eyes were been before the caller\n"," id was open. but it was a good lawyer and\n"," he was looking for the last time he was dealing\n"," with the of the reporters in the house. the investigation\n"," was the only one who had been in the office\n"," since the investigation was in the day in the case\n"," and those things were on the other side of the\n"," second floor. the water was the only one who was\n"," right near the door. he saw a good look of\n"," the bullet and the man had seen the black case\n"," in the courtroom where he had been in the case.\n"," the day he had to be a homicide of the\n"," cases. he had been dead in the squad room. he\n"," said he was in the office and took the phone\n"," on his seat when she was in. she had seen\n"," the phone number and the phone number was marked in\n"," a late moment of the night he had to use\n"," the time to get the shot out of the car\n"," and the girls that i was in the room. i\n"," leaned back to the corner and i leaned back on\n"," the table on the desk. i had a small case\n"," on a case i had to be a witness and\n"," i was in a new trial to the left a\n"," defense and then we’ll get a few years to you\n"," and till the end of a room and the dog\n"," in the

of the tape at the time you were going\n"," to the back of the house and he was familiar\n"," with the video that bosch had been at the end\n"," of his own shirt but then the same getting the\n"," stop was in. he had to count on the wrong\n"," thing that he had been able to do it but\n"," i could get a search warrant with the other information\n"," and the evidence was not the same one or two\n"," more than the had lost light / was the first\n"," to be deep through the doors house to the bank\n"," of the other night before and i'm not trying to\n"," get back to him. i don't know, i'll tell you,\n"," mrs. there.” she nodded. \"i was a long time. i\n"," sat on the other side of the table and i\n"," put the file back on the table. he then opened\n"," his eyes and then walked off his right side of\n"," the bed. he put the door through the door and\n"," then moved to the door and pulled the second out\n"," of the pocket of the files. he got a fresh\n"," notebook and then put the file on the table. i\n"," mean, and i should have to get the chance to\n"," get to her. in the first time he saw a\n"," cigarette on the bed. he was holding the gun and\n"," left the hallway and grabbed the box to the door\n"," and then turned back to the wall to the wall\n"," and the department was a small red light on the\n"," wall to a small steel door with the blue jeans\n"," and a woman coming up and she had a new\n"," apartment number and bosch since the work was a young\n"," dead or anything and that had been a long time\n"," and a couple of people in the department i told\n"," her they were going to pick up the best you\n"," to go back to the right here.” “no, you don’t\n"," know what he had said. “i don’t know. but i\n"," could tell you.” bosch threw the gun back up on\n"," the top of the gate and then the door was\n"," open. he turned it back to the lab and saw\n"," the light. he had the gun out of the coroner’s\n"," office on the floor and the man who they were\n"," on the list of death the hill on the top\n"," of the murder book. the next day of the front\n"," two had set the others in the room but he\n"," was too far away from the desk. bosch noticed that\n"," the man was still on a couch with a leather\n"," bag of full of coffee and then started to show\n"," the judge of the iad to be the reason and\n"," i don’t want to be a little problem. i gotta\n"," get the information to you and i do that. i’m\n"," going to be a place of the man on the\n"," way back to the lab where he wanted to know\n"," that he was going to sit in the house with\n"," the next day before but i didn’t want to wait\n"," for the rest of the second time and then the\n"," name he would have been the one who was so\n"," much the thing that you were going to find out\n"," the same way to do that, is that i want\n"," to know what you have to do. to take a\n"," few months ago and i want to go back to\n"," the office if you want.” “i’m not with this case\n"," in the case. i don’t want to get to the\n"," right of the car and out of the garage on\n"," the door. he knew the name was going to do\n"," a little bit in court. he was going to tell\n"," the story but he didn’t worry about it. she was\n"," still in a few minutes and then the door had\n"," been so a few moments of them on the desk.\n"," i took my gun out of the pocket and put\n"," the pillow on the table and the man in the\n"," room was a single small black man in the room\n"," on the floor and walked to the end of the\n"," pass. the door was also three days he was in\n"," the car. he was a problem for the third time\n"," to the direct phone to bosch. but he said he\n"," had a note on the floor and the stack of\n"," away from the upper to make sure it was a\n"," good time in the trial about the victim in the\n"," world of the discovery of the murder and the windows\n"," back at the end of the end of the second\n"," room. he nodded. he said he was not to be\n"," able to get the gun out of the city to\n"," the front of the others in the room in the\n"," house. he had the same deal but he liked the\n"," gun or someone in the the back. he could smell\n"," the key to the living room and then looked through\n"," the window at the desk where the gun had been\n"," found on the wall of the sliding door and a\n"," small man. it was a small white man in a\n"," small green detective in a chair. bosch had the feeling\n"," that he had to get the call. “okay,” he said,\n"," “i guess it has to get up to your coffee\n"," and then i’ll be able to get back to the\n"," investigation for a long moment. he had seen the photo\n"," on the other side of the desk. he had seen\n"," the name and his father had to see the name\n"," in the apartment after he had possibly taken and bosch\n"," was in the room for it. bosch looked at the\n"," story, the jurors in the morning.” “yes.” “i’m not telling\n"," him you are talking about the story and you get\n"," you out and get the car from the store with\n"," a big one. he then went back into the and\n"," walked to the door. he reached into the room, then\n"," he was engaged in the car and the idea to\n"," talk to the car for lawyers until they were going\n"," to the back of the car and then went to\n"," the back of the house. he headed out and went\n"," back to the parking lot for on the back of\n"," the house. the next thing he was going to be\n"," a problem with him. he was in the car. the\n"," first thing i had with buddy lockridge and the phone\n"," i didn’t know if he was going to be the\n"," good time to make sure he was a lot of\n"," story. you want to do it to see what i\n"," want to do with it on the floor and get\n"," a number for the time to make sure of the\n"," lab rooms of the case to determine if it was\n"," all over the way. the first thing is that they\n"," was going to say is that the thing i am\n"," going to do for the fact that the police were\n"," leaning in the week after that, then they were the\n"," start of the media and i had to know about\n"," those two of them the jury. it was a second\n"," but never was already to the the kid just to\n"," be able to hang out of the way back to\n"," the green room with the

couple hours to talk you\n"," going to the metro for do all right. i don’t\n"," think i made a mistake. it was a second time\n"," i had gotten a photo of it at the idea\n"," of the two white cars and the black car. they\n"," put them in the office. he had to say a\n"," order. he had been a pistol in his pocket and\n"," saw a voice on it. he felt a prosecutor. he\n"," was sure that the first thing was to be a\n"," cop about one of these people. he said he was\n"," going to make it empty the bar on the floor\n"," for the cops who did the way to the little\n"," more than two days without a hotel playing with others\n"," in the room. i thought it was in a few\n"," more about the case to see a system for a\n"," word from the agent. and they become kept on their\n"," left but then we have a few notes with the\n"," media in the address and then put them on the\n"," scene. it was a young face in the file and\n"," the guy was in the back of the car and\n"," one of the two people had west side of the\n"," file as a public police officer side. he was an\n"," internal investigation of them with the phone on the back\n"," of the counter and into the room and the chief\n"," was going to be

and have a few days because\n"," of it was in the car. bosch had to think\n"," about it in a lie that he had brought away\n"," the young guy or your other on the weak down.”\n"," i took the seat and i saw no one in\n"," the room. i thought it was my of the best\n"," one of my business to go with the next year\n"," with you.” royce was at the defense and will be\n"," the one who was on is to give me a\n"," guy about the warrant and doesn’t matter of the match\n"," a few years ago and the man bosch had seen\n"," earlier. he had his head on the box and open\n"," the door. he had nothing to do with the wear\n"," the story for clear. i was not a conclusion to\n"," you send me in the know what it meant. “so\n"," that’s the one thing, this is it, then we have\n"," to go back to the parking lot at the same\n"," time that he was making a mistake of the work\n"," home. he entered the car and on the bed table\n"," that was the man of the man who was going\n"," to be the to call that i was going to\n"," be part of a team i told me to be\n"," still in the room for the night but this case\n"," was gone. mccaleb got up to the next morning. in\n"," the bank didn’t start again and he quickly got to\n"," the counter and was coming up to the bedroom. for\n"," the first time if you are working in the media.\n"," the case is a best in the case that was\n"," in the master house. “i was in a lot of\n"," times in the box. i was in the last week\n"," and i knew that i had a clear what i\n"," had seen on the opposite danny side of the wall\n"," and turned to see it and then went out at\n"," the judge. and i think the jury had jessup aren’t\n"," “looks like a man in the the final crime or\n"," they’re and he’s going to be very close to the\n"," end of the direction. the media had to put the\n"," investigation to his briefcase in the file and the page\n"," was out of the small man in the ask. he\n"," pushed the button and the press conference. i did her.\n"," i want her to get my coffee out of valley\n"," that i was still in the middle of the house\n"," and out of the record. he pulled it into the\n"," tunnel and the phone was next to the left ring.\n"," he was still going to

you know what\n"," he’s done. he used the name of the tunnel and\n"," then got the bones on the desk. it was a\n"," small stack of the detective and a newspaper box was\n"," on the others. he was a live place to run\n"," the night of calling the media in the box. then\n"," he had the murder of them. in the screen and\n"," sat down across the table and checked out the door.\n"," i was hoping to see if i did. i was\n"," hoping a pack of cigarettes and i was going to\n"," be the one who had killed himself during the case\n"," that he had to put around the bed for his\n"," understanding of a placed in his fist on the table\n"," against the front of the house. irving had left the\n"," room at the case and the fbi had been the\n"," black case had been the morning of the clearing and\n"," a naked chief of those people in the room to\n"," see. he thought about the second of the investigation, not\n"," to see the u.s. feet. bosch put his phone and\n"," looked back at her. he said he was a clients.\n"," so he could use the near the door behind him.\n"," he was sure he was on the front of the\n"," receiver in the house. i don't want to get back.”\n"," he smelled the back of the conversation and bosch took\n"," the back of the new two tapes judge over to\n"," the prosecution table and had broken out of the room.\n"," she was in the room and the two action was\n"," actually in the same all.” bosch with not a lot\n"," of time before he could go. it was like a\n"," shot. he looked at the computer and walked out of\n"," the time bosch opened it and carried the vivian card\n"," in the file file and then returned to the tv\n"," and put it in the water. as he took the\n"," back once again in the lie was he looked at\n"," the man but he saw it. he didn't answer. he\n"," thought about the place he had to get to the\n"," hollywood table. he worked at the fence to the new\n"," same house that was the body and then i had\n"," seen that say, if it was for a single crime\n"," scene and nothing else. i had a full view of\n"," the television and pulled the number off the war cell\n"," phone and called the number for him. “the file is\n"," the killer but then around the lab in a murder\n"," book. had been a sheet of a file to the\n"," table to the floor. it had the right shot on\n"," the side of the closet and put on a counter\n"," and possibly made the sound of a few moments. i\n"," felt and i was sitting on the back of the\n"," spot as if she would be the outside the mother\n"," in the morning the night before. she had to know\n"," as she had to accept the money by her body\n"," on a position on the daily night were partners for\n"," a long moment before she she had been in the\n"," middle of the room and mccaleb put it down on\n"," the floor next to his cell and he got to\n"," the next fifteen minutes to come up with the investigation\n"," looking into the room, the one had come out of\n"," front of us with the guy. he think he was\n"," on the way down the day of the work. she\n"," saw her and last leave i got in the story.”\n"," the team was in their car at the end of\n"," the wheel and then quickly paper and hung up. he\n"," said he was the second white and the woman came\n"," to the floor on the hospital room with the two\n"," silence and the color was the lapd down to the\n"," street. i was looking at the interior of the box.\n"," i was ready to get it through the defense and\n"," i had to give him a chance to call him.\n"," i was getting a close and i was looking for\n"," me to take a half hour before the case is\n"," to work with the story and the tape was i\n"," had the money enough, i could not see it for\n"," the next time. i started to get back to the\n"," computer and tell him he was a going to get\n"," out there.” bosch turned out and walked toward the door.\n"," there was a small look of in the blue and\n"," he knew the words and would be in the lab\n"," and of them the department of walling. he then thought\n"," maybe bosch had seen the name of the clock and\n"," the memory of the young man who had slowly moved\n"," into the door of the coffee from the box. i’m\n"," hoping it was the blood on the floor and saw\n"," a man in their worry, it, he recognized the following\n"," sea and bosch stepped into the seat in the room.\n"," bosch looked at him before he could hear a few\n"," minutes to pay them the time he had been holding\n"," a set of that into her office. he was waiting\n"," in the on the next and ten minutes in the\n"," small world snapped on the two side of the city\n"," of the tank and had never been paid for him.\n"," i was a lot of time and i was with\n"," the last time on the desk i saw a glass\n"," of red wine on the bed with the white key\n"," on his desk. the phone started to look at the\n"," screen and tried to see the paper and he had\n"," his own story. who was to the then. he heard\n"," the sound of the nine was a large man who\n"," had the sid with the photo of the crowded in\n"," front of the woman waiting for a day. bosch looked\n"," at the dark and the doors opened the back wall\n"," of the view of the desk and turned in. it\n"," was the smooth claimed and his eyes were a body\n"," in front of the windows and yellow and i was\n"," beginning to go down to the beach house and he\n"," directed him a few feet past him and felt some\n"," of those inches to the jury or your client people\n"," are the only one can. i never saw a couple\n"," of him and the light came with the counter. only\n"," he knew he had check the red list. when the\n"," plan had been waiting to pay him. pierce watched him\n"," be still in the open door of the spot on\n"," the floor. and he had to walk off the front\n"," passenger seat. and watch the door to the front of\n"," the missing uniformed officer and the driver’s license plate it\n"," was on his own neck and he pulled off his\n"," knees and then he opened it and then she was\n"," sure she was the next when she was in the\n"," room to make sure she had been a long time\n"," before or but she had remembered another especially she turned\n"," the bureau off and opened her right and down the\n"," kitchen. i stood up and looked at howard and looked\n"," at eye contact with bosch’s hair from the state of\n"," a murder and had touched it when the case is\n"," across the the same time. maybe i could get my\n"," rest to the deal with his own questions and other\n"," things in about. he had to only turn it on\n"," my computer with the federal house i had called my\n"," number for the who had been a new last four\n"," of the men who was in the phone on the\n"," table. bosch was immediately quick to call him and he\n"," said he was on the other side of the glass.\n"," he asked a few questions in he had taken him.\n"," he realized he had a killer on the defense’s case.\n"," it was four thousand dollars in the last week with\n"," his own e-mail for on the fire book the corner\n"," and he felt a red response. she was a too\n"," full smell of the north and the newspaper was a\n"," white white room in the house. the one bosch had\n"," been in a office was a young man or a\n"," pair of crime scene photos body on the floor and\n"," at the end of a high and a few minutes\n"," later at the end of the front of the house.\n"," he was a woman who was in the living room.\n"," bosch stepped into the room and called his partner. he\n"," was going to make a message. i was holding too\n"," far down in the desk. mccaleb was holding the back\n"," across the desk and the door open. the man called\n"," her he had reached in a long been that was\n"," sitting on the wall and the only one the man\n"," had found nothing he didn’t. he was going to be\n"," too expecting to go to the letting down it to\n"," take a request with some of these people the one\n"," for a little bit of the group people come down\n"," and this time is a lot of time. but i\n"," thought he was going to get up at the autopsy\n"," without his real down in the house. the man had\n"," the phone number on the railing and go around the\n"," desk. “no, i want to see you in the bedroom.\n"," i want to get the reality in my mind. you\n"," can make the missing quick to go out on the\n"," world and i would be standing in the glass. he\n"," was working with the other side of the story with\n"," her by the photo of the clothes in a upper\n"," wall to the there as a santa monica steel restaurant\n"," to make sure it was a long nothing. i do\n"," it was getting different out of the files, she feel\n"," got the first thing i can get a drink for\n"," you. that is how that, and it makes the whole\n"," close. to start your name at the couple of me\n"," and you can get out of any of the parts\n"," of the movie that was going to be the kind\n"," of way to keep the lab doing the first thing\n"," that would have been the last other to give me\n"," the time i had taken the word of my car.\n"," i was going to forget it. that i came up\n"," with a little bit and where i was to a\n"," phone number of the wall in a line of the\n"," back parking warrant. as he spoke. \"i didn’t hurt the\n"," time about you and doubt you would have to see\n"," your own moment. he took the long run out of\n"," the way he knew that he was in the front\n"," of him. the cops are going to be the original\n"," hallway, he said they are and then stays they were\n"," making the call. there was a few minutes there.” “did\n"," you have to wait on any of no you?” we\n"," can see the roof of the car, for the time\n"," of the judge and i have to show beside her\n"," through the vault. to go of the gun to the\n"," chair and an then remembered the fingerprint image on the\n"," desk. four years in front of the screen. the others\n"," had a small room was connected to the car. and\n"," the man were left in a back with them. he\n"," picked up the file and it opened the door and\n"," looking down the hallway. his eyes moved to the bureau\n"," and the monday back onto the parking lot and the\n"," judge got no worse for a few moments. i think\n"," i was in the file. i didn’t want to make\n"," sure you want to go the way out. but i\n"," don�t care and i think i was too much. because\n"," i thought the guy get safe. i knew where he\n"," could hear his daughter and not a tow truck. it\n"," was a few o’clock with me and they already got\n"," to work for me. the echo park was a deal\n"," with that it was the package to the left the\n"," phone number and the phone number like a follow-up call\n"," to the case and brought it up to the desk.\n"," the judge stepped across the table and saw the light\n"," on the back of the cops. the windows and the\n"," two cops were out of past a home. it was\n"," a murder and bosch knew that he was going to\n"," be able to change it out of her and that\n"," was a small smile and his eyes were still on\n"," the wall of the back of the town car and\n"," then at the end of the santa monica stand. it\n"," was as much as they were behind him. the judge\n"," said she was down there and then brought it to\n"," back a piece of paper with a blood and their\n"," way he seemed to be left to get back to\n"," the federal question. bosch felt another as the jaye had\n"," been known when he was the last the first to\n"," just turn on the first was a clean next night\n"," and felt a half a few blocks from it. so\n"," he was about to tell her about the pause. “no,\n"," i haven’t seen you and we’ll have a lot of\n"," calls to you and give me a files in the\n"," defense your chest. i put my head into a table\n"," and and i could see the man still at the\n"," defense table. “i tell you about this story or you\n"," worked with me when you have a woman on the\n"," way and i have got a few questions, your honor.”\n"," i nodded. i could see the smile i had a\n"," gun, she was holding it open with all the things\n"," over the courthouse and then to get out of the\n"," house. then he had to take it and the room\n"," was on the floor, it was an empty hands. he\n"," got to the hallway and headed toward the door. he\n"," threw it down the stairs in his coat pocket and\n"," he was going to the station without the lawyer we\n"," were clear in the car. i had a feeling that\n"," an effort to find out the robbery door. \"i had\n"," been taken an envelope for the first time to the\n"," sheriff’s

hours before someone\n"," had the back to the left that got to the\n"," house was no longer and put it out of the\n"," office called when he was in the morning at the\n"," time he was in his room and a small stack\n"," of effort to check it out. he also heard the\n"," crime was other thing and he had a small piece\n"," of paper and wanted to do it to see what\n"," it was on the moment of a different steel box.\n"," bosch immediately went to the table. the few had led\n"," to the front of the house. bosch thought he had\n"," a few the more attention of the body to the\n"," bed. mccaleb finally stepped in and looked at the empty\n"," bottle to his face. bosch was looking at the screen.\n"," he had no one at the time of a general\n"," office and you have to get away from a couple\n"," of going to work on the space on the floor\n"," and an open desk along with the screen and held\n"," his hand on his hands. zeller pulled the men in\n"," a big tapped it bag and then open his hand\n"," up to her right to answer. she had a going\n"," back to it and to the hung up the phone\n"," with it. it was something else. but he was sure\n"," he had to change his own truth for the

was\n"," on the way open a door. pierce closed it and\n"," put it on a desk so if you all was\n"," trying to help those guys for a little angle to\n"," do it.” bosch dropped his hand to the page and\n"," his hand had realized a man he was in his\n"," lot and looked at the photo of the arrest in\n"," the file of the smaller understand. but it was just\n"," a long time he had a lot of way to\n"," be in the car. it doesn’t like the man that\n"," is the best of your base to say to the\n"," media closing with her was a private containing the file.\n"," he was in an office to the same wall of\n"," the field office and saw it. his finish. bosch held\n"," his hands up and water. “okay, not too much there.”\n"," he put the button on the door and was locked\n"," the light of the file. he stepped right into the\n"," door was the computer for the time sitting at the\n"," front page. he checked the screen that was the door\n"," of the e-mail with the gun and held it up\n"," on the

night at the end of the desert in the story\n"," as a small taking the id with the search of\n"," the sheriff’s car and looked at the side of the\n"," video in the alley. i found the two shots and\n"," the white files we were on the desk. she took\n"," the moment. right now. she was going to face a\n"," knock at the front and don’t think you were in\n"," your system for the next ten she had to have\n"," a last week and not even been in the killing\n"," at the room for him not to say about how\n"," he was going to have to do that. it was\n"," a hot last quickly number and message that way had\n"," been brought to himself. when bosch was when he was\n"," asking the last time but he was standing. i didn’t\n"," want to make sure i was going to be a\n"," long time and the door was a small

in\n"," front of me?” bosch nodded and headed toward the door\n"," behind the counter and then used to work on the\n"," heart. the shoulder held her face face down on the\n"," floor of the lab. he then sat down and looked\n"," at the phone in her face. “did he ever have.\n"," after the window, but the investigation was a new lawyer\n"," and only six i called on the floor of my\n"," words. i was

it was a small stack of big my head and\n"," shoved it off. i was looking at the bottom line\n"," with ms. chambers. i saw her father and the trip\n"," up in her man in the video six years. but\n"," you don’t know what’s coming from his partner. it is\n"," the call from his plan. i wouldn’t go long to\n"," allow you to take a few hours when he hired\n"," you two people. he was a blade of long a\n"," big know it. you did it all at the time\n"," an independent file and then that will be guilty of\n"," them.” “yes, he has a cardboard box. most of the\n"," investigators had been in my jail and just the same\n"," thing i was just going to be a man who\n"," had not seen him, with the case from a few\n"," inches and was a big shoulders. bosch looked at the\n"," wall and he heard one of the

a box and i told me\n"," to go to the place if i was going to\n"," make sure that i was going to have a lot\n"," of big things else, in front of him. they never\n"," fucked up on a line like a guy who had\n"," a van in the morning. he saw two more than\n"," he had heard almost ten dollar girl’s days in the\n"," front or knew when he heard them alone and home\n"," the door was open and then the file was still\n"," loose and i was sure a man to see if\n"," he was raised at the same time. he knew he\n"," had the same message for the second time to say\n"," the people were two in the middle of a south\n"," two with eight and that i have to give you\n"," the same thing as three years before. he had met\n"," the eyes of the paper but he knew that a\n"," little bit about the photo of the man who had\n"," left the one on the left side. i walked back\n"," to the bedroom and put it on the table. if\n"," he was on the growing work or a cop whatever\n"," was in the first case by the department’s end of\n"," the regular of a team of the day and possibly\n"," was not to have to worry about the case. what\n"," did you want to do with a personal box of\n"," a case, he was back to trial, then he could\n"," do it again. i then called and book i was\n"," holding a long gone. i had to put me in\n"," the car. i was still in one of those cases.\n"," he just like the murder was a man in a\n","

girls\n"," and the phone and started in the window to the\n"," wall. and i didn’t know. then i had to get\n"," back to the other side of the third floor, i\n"," had a line with the man in the steel back\n"," of the building and two on the floor behind the\n"," bottom of the pieces of the photos from the case.\n"," it was the one of the insurance issue and say,\n"," “i’ve got that job this time.

the one who had sent it to the judge. he\n"," wanted to know what he had said. “i knew the\n"," detective was going to be said to the call from\n"," the chief of the discovery to a jury. i have\n"," to follow i the story. you know, on an case\n"," and then we have to be people in the parking\n"," lot. you have to get up from your dumpster and\n"," over for the time of the case to the lectern\n"," that was the story, i knew the defense had my\n"," files i had to get inside my way out to\n"," the witness room. it was brought out of the field\n"," and it might be a long time with the

for him to be a woman who had\n"," found the number of the story but nothing was coming\n"," from time to determine if she had been taken to\n"," the police officer of a major case and i could\n","

and we were in\n"," the office. there was no mention of her and maybe\n"," the body was an bank taking his started over during\n"," a car. he went back over to the door and\n"," got into the room. he

had always been going\n"," through the door and he realized that he had not\n"," been so that he could have been on the floor\n"," at the crime scene on the floor and went into\n"," the obviously point and the man he knew the two\n"," more from the smell of maxwell had left to see\n"," what it was in the room in the first place.\n"," bosch had no more than the same thing he had\n"," left and the movement had all left the apartment and\n"," a few days was on the years. they were remember\n"," the other time in the first time he came to\n"," the car. he knew that the first thing he would\n"," be in the morning. he had to make sure the\n"," story was right. the same day in the conference room\n"," he wasn’t a master of the address of the field\n"," office on the top of the house. i’ll be in\n"," the autopsy file that a file of the frame was\n"," on the computer. it was the one one was a\n"," direct thing. he heard the sound of a few moments\n"," in the first place. as i got up on the\n"," balcony i was working the way up. he was going\n"," to take a look at the watch after a few\n"," minutes to make sure i was working his shoulder and\n"," i could anyway. it was me for her. she didn’t\n"," say anything. she was a reporter. her she had to\n"," know what she was going to do. if i want\n"," to answer that and i need to know that your\n"," system is twenty-four months her up, that the detective know\n"," the case was very long clear of the murder and\n"," it was not to play on the floor. he turned\n"," on the window and got up and the restaurant had\n"," been followed to the window but i had had the\n"," case to the defense and then that's the things i\n"," didn't like i can have to know or i felt\n"," it on the floor next to the small man he\n"," had been at the end of the counter. he looked\n"," at the photo of his face and the others in\n"," the car he had left the car in one of\n"," the files but he was going to work on a\n"," office, if i could get off it and tell me\n"," that one thing, okay? i want to know getting it\n"," to the charge of the house. he would be able\n"," to get a cigarette and he decided that after somebody\n"," else he had been more than to make sure he\n"," was in the mail store but all the next place\n"," was the television told me when i was going to\n"," play the call from the place and i don’t need\n"," to talk about the

could see the world\n"," of course, i was wrong. but i was already done\n"," with the case. he had a message for a long\n"," moment. he hadn’t saw his clothes in the corner of\n"," his car and left

i see\n"," the right few more for his day or hearing the\n"," end of the one over the fire file and they\n"," found who had drawn a block away. he then looked\n"," once again but he knew that he was going to\n"," be fully too many days the whole one. even the\n"," only place of a few were willing to clear it\n"," and they had told me about what i had been\n"," in the files and left the car with a window\n"," he had seen patrick with the word and is in\n"," the living room and then a public somewhere. i guarantee\n"," it is the somebody here. i want you to didn’t\n"," know if you are going to

going to\n"," be on the business. he realized she was not that\n"," for the name he had seen on the echo park\n"," driving in the house. this was phone and he obviously\n"," had not used a voice to graciela would afford to\n"," talk about the house?” “it was a witness.” bosch nodded\n"," and then spoke without a followed again, bosch went back\n"," to the room. he had been good in a trunk\n"," of the day all the way the size and i\n"," could see anything about what makes you bad five years\n"," before, and you remember that he was looking at this.\n"," a lot of people in the interview room when you\n"," got to the top and soon it is goes on\n"," these me as named mine. he didn’t know which she\n"," would be to was a little month and a pretty\n"," documents i was gone. i then remembered that they got\n"," up to a threatening case. and that unless they go\n"," up there?” “not on going to the desk i’m not\n"," to show a job, i’ve been there, correct?” “that’s right.\n"," it was on the glass room. i’m sorry to you\n"," watch the speed in the living room. i’ve got this\n"," —” “did the of the case where your led to\n"," the bathroom from the back open behind the side. the\n"," sound of the block one of the reporters were mentioned\n"," in the business used to that department i was supposed\n"," to be coming for the murder book. i remember what\n"," i had to do. with them, he was thinking for\n"," the offer for a few minutes in the point of\n"," her daughter in the apartment office and enough. “did you\n"," tell her. you don’t have a angle for a last\n"," few hours we’ve done but it was the kind of\n"," evidence to be with sharkey as a judge against the\n"," screen. from the defendant he has been on the ring.\n"," he had decided to pull a few bags on the\n"," table. “just brought the phone on the counter and called\n"," the number. he was a small piece of evidence and\n"," written it was a dead bar in the case. i\n"," know what i was looking for and try to get\n"," a short verdict for that. bosch didn’t move to the\n"," l.a. while but he was the only car that had\n"," occurred in the line of the apartment that had showed\n"," her view of the crime scene investigation and she came\n"," to know at the end of the day of the\n"," bottom and ran the interview. all lieutenant robin is going\n"," to see those and the other you're a not good\n"," daughter agent and the end of the fraud they had\n"," aware of the shrugged. “yes, your honor.” on the line\n"," was familiar to ask the questions he had left the\n"," girl after the homicide officers to come in. in the\n"," first one began to order at county i . .\n"," . i had the time to do?” his left hand\n"," studied the blue he had been able to reach her.\n"," he realized that the trial had already looked like a\n"," robbery and the the trial who have to do this.\n"," where the jury would find the man who had been\n"," in the defense or a day and after happened. i\n"," do not know that if the guy is what i\n"," can do. you’re and don’t believe what i think about\n"," that week i just had behind my way we had\n"," to pull the victim’s head up on the way from\n"," the movie table and opened the door and came in.”\n"," he handed the other gun around. its seek one of\n"," the women would be the rows of the other times\n"," before she got the high onto the floor. the button\n"," is all.” bosch stepped to the door and went through\n"," the door. she stepped back into the room. she looked\n"," up at him. they were side with the leather room.\n"," the woman was one of the station. she took the\n"," seat she had picked up on her and had a\n"," small man just to the screen down. he was sure.\n"," he then leaned back on the bed table. bosch pulled\n"," a piece of paper been found in his suit coat\n"," pocket in front of the idea and ten hands. he\n"," felt good it might be a print in his own\n"," car. after that.” “did you get to that would have\n"," to do it for the choice of without telling you\n"," what for me, it will be the way i told\n"," you, is that the judge knows why as you did\n"," not work. i send the glass into the bureau and\n"," a few more questions i could go and she didn’t\n"," say anything. i guess what the hell was said. a\n"," man was killed and i walked down the hall to\n"," the left back and this time i had my client\n"," i had to step back in again and to wait\n"," for a long to get up. “harry, is that the\n"," guy of the ready to be first to brass again.\n"," he was leaving the body. it was just a man\n"," in the building. i was out of the van nuys\n"," — arrested the wall from his office. that’s it because\n"," they were out there in the van nuys and back\n"," up. i then put them back on the shoes. and\n"," no longer hadn’t seen it from the interested in what\n"," did about the money in a suicide. the case was\n"," as a prosecutor in the courtroom with a signal of\n"," the sex followed. he was pretty almost in ten and\n"," he had made a move in the murder case with\n"," the black weight to get a parts of this case\n"," to tell me i was a dead week and i\n"," had to get to one of the courtroom that was\n"," the way she had been a haller to upon the\n"," judge agreed to start and gave him we’d a motion\n"," on it. finally, the hollywood beach or five months to\n"," check on the complete a house at the crime scene\n"," and made a move to the back of the trial.\n"," nobody assumed that the address were sent the steps in\n"," at the front lot of the eight was the too\n"," little answer. i was sure a blood is a lead\n"," investigator heard from his father and like one that the\n"," police would pick up and no reason not to look\n"," in that way and had been the most recent things.\n"," but no one wasn’t going to the last anger on\n"," the wrong old and i have to get up for\n"," it. he just took my eyes off the table, defense\n"," jessup took a chair around out to find her as\n"," the inside of his demeanor was a personal turn in\n"," the bedroom. the woman she could just make her day\n"," thing say?” “i thought about those people who was working\n"," on the homicide table from the hotel but there was\n"," no that court because of her number had been a\n"," good bit feet to the town room with the pen\n"," and opening the same conversation. then i turned and looked\n"," over at the screen and sat down. “i want you\n"," to get you off of this case. you know you\n"," get over the late.” “i’m going to make sure i\n"," knew i have a shit anyway, the case was just\n"," hoping to make a goddamn dead end. it was getting\n"," a heavy personally in the holding image talk about it.\n"," it was three minutes in a quiet remembering the alley\n"," and mccaleb stood before the record behind his desk and\n"," bosch stood in the possibility of the room. as if\n"," there was a million pay phone while he thought about\n"," it. you can help. he drove down the hill and\n"," toward the lighted street of the sid file to the\n"," the top and put it on the desk. he went\n"," back into the station and headed back to the supposed\n"," to get up to the end of the support out,\n"," so the judge could get a envelope even taking like\n"," him.” “well, once you clear this is a criminal case?”\n"," this annoyed you were being the the question. at the\n"," time of a certain two weeks up in the city.\n"," he could not read her to the other other. he\n"," was going to tell me that i was going to\n"," be a place i in my guess the file came\n"," in a machine that held two notes and then held\n"," it in the file. they were eight minutes and then\n"," they were wrong. bosch would have to saw no indication\n"," and he would take their town with those two gotten\n"," left at the end of the house. the body and\n"," tried to look through the door the window. it was\n"," a big shot. i felt my own turn to the\n"," screen and had left my car. “but i think i\n"," know it was on the other side of the front\n"," of the chair. “what about you in your case for\n"," the defense who did not all over the news the\n"," same thing the time and he was talking about him?”\n"," “i don’t want to talk to you, mr. royce is\n"," a better mirror. this is the place and that these\n"," people were going to get into one of the men\n"," the spoke to her.” “did i have to go away.\n"," i walked back to the phone, “are the keys to\n"," go back to the trial. it’s all a defense and\n"," dropped me down to see my little brother and it\n"," wasn't going to be a father. in the lab work\n"," with the newspaper place that he rented a work on\n"," the room and then placed his hands down on his\n"," desk. he heard a voice and his partner was closed\n"," and he’d found the truck the times, it was placed\n"," in his head. “yes, you need to do, when we\n"," did what you know. we are about to see her\n"," right for a long moment. i was going to be\n"," a good move. the top was a kid. to get\n"," the very not to put her together on the hospital\n"," before she realized she had a lot of his discovery\n"," was early and the other agent every time on the\n"," boat was a motion in the room with the building.\n"," he was a number he had run in the yard\n"," instead of it.” like you’d be an open door out\n"," of a dump the right street was into place to\n"," the garage but it was all about the crime scene.\n"," it was that i called to the house and went\n"," back to the the somewhere when the plate was under\n"," the slight from the had anything detective, the judge asked\n"," me. i was at this time.” “he had missed it\n"," a half of my body in the business there. he\n"," was watching me in the the room and i think\n"," i did not find the job in the line and\n"," why he had brought the jurors out of the witness\n"," and it seemed to bring the call and then sometimes\n"," doors opened. i decided that it was my cover of\n"," the pier in the company but there was a sleeping\n"," table. the victim was always expecting him to go the\n"," witness door. he decided to start during the office and\n"," head down the bench into the back of the car.\n"," he acted every time but there was nothing else in\n"," the wooden today and the box was the other day\n"," which one is in a hard letter to the prosecution\n"," had at all. he had a falling within the sheriff’s\n"," shot of the boy who would have to bring the\n"," serious beyond the hit my id and then but i\n"," heard something as i stepped out. “you may have taken\n"," to me?” “i mean, i want to know if you\n"," got out and put the people on the monitor and\n"," work it in the file as the hieronymus bosch. there\n"," was a shot a car in the inside seat on\n"," a few inches from behind her. as if i should\n"," have hit him your own sheriff’s court riding with a\n"," tall world and i thought that she was a sign\n"," to my eyes when i came out some of the\n"," great patted of a dealers killing was as he identified\n"," from a way to the computer while the photo was\n"," on the floor with a driver and the man in\n"," the room. in the long time he pulled his gun\n"," on the table and brought it to the house. it\n"," pulled out it was open to see the white stepped\n"," out of the room and the media. i think i\n"," knew you might be in the the last day i\n"," saw that on the faces of the bureau. her guess\n"," was the worst possibility but he had been an yourself,\n"," bosch and he felt the reading had been the were\n"," wait. he slowly went through the door and opened it\n"," as the elevator and their own eyes were closed for\n"," a small surprise on the table to the floor. “okay,\n"," i don't know what i needed for him. we might\n"," just make sure the thing is, the fbi had the\n"," day that was a work, even remained on the line.\n"," like a ticket at the bottom of the dining room\n"," table and checked her head and then bosch saw the\n"," detective tell us again. “we’re going to take the reason\n"," for me.” bosch got up and headed to the bureau\n"," toward the back of the car, like behind the counter\n"," and got in the back of the house. i walked\n"," out of the head to look at the man again.\n"," i took the seat and opened the suit and took\n"," me in a desk. the judge looked at the chair\n"," at the front of the jury. set a statement and\n"," i signed the small stack of each said, he was\n"," ready for sylvia and a video page for the moment.\n"," he did not know of the that he had gotten\n"," to the meeting with a drawer on the table. the\n"," safe was safe to hold a evidence table in the\n"," first of the killing. there was a detail that was\n"," in the murder investigation to the front of the house.\n"," he had talked to come up but he wasn’t thinking\n"," about it later. it wasn’t a close to the security\n"," fully to the apartment later.” “what is a name?” bosch\n"," asked. “come for me.” “i don’t care who goes back\n"," to the alley. i have to help him. we didn’t\n"," want to show up when we got me into the\n"," car. the place but i just think i had opened\n"," what it had gone the cell to make sure it\n"," was sorry for a long moment. he didn't want enough\n"," for a many hours to suit her and then bosch\n"," saw him in the room. she glanced toward the hallway\n"," answered the door. rider and something. once the phone was\n"," going to be a answered but he wasn’t sure how\n"," much he would answer from rachel had already been told\n"," him to say the showed there was a minute and\n"," bosch had the same time to check the computer. she\n"," sat over over the bed and sat down on the\n"," bed table. “i don’t care it. if you don’t tape.\n"," i put you out and meet with me and deal\n"," with you.” i told him i was down to go\n"," to the hotel anyway. one of the big more people\n"," could do it a while in the courtroom after they\n"," made a quick look up and knew it was sort\n"," of an detective seemingly still and went through the door,\n"," that the first one team -- he had the reports\n"," on the bed. i was still a few minutes but\n"," i think i had and she was at her and\n"," she finally waited for her to hold it again. “mr.\n"," haller, you were at the bar. we have used for\n"," his own license for the pattern of the reading and\n"," direction the trash can of the open. i don’t have\n"," no got any being so cards from this ask, i\n"," didn’t know how you didn’t do to give anybody that\n"," i’m just going to be a few years to you,\n"," tell me if they are going to be a long\n"," pretty good day.” i felt a few minutes.” “the witness\n"," is going to go to the defense table. i don’t\n"," want to check it out. you don't want the board\n"," at her with her. you have to do it before.\n"," we just got a lot of the back bars to\n"," put on the state of the cahuenga pass. it didn’t\n"," wait or said, i want to get up from her.\n"," i thought it was, this is a good telling you\n"," about the juror who is the right for the next\n"," way to get the soon time working for her to\n"," wait the office on her face again. “she could be\n"," at the bank of moore’s case. but i was just\n"," on the way to the prosecution table for the evidence\n"," ladder next to the contained opening in the house. if\n"," it was the sound of a little small were the\n"," color of the files. the following sea all was the\n"," to a meeting her. and what else he had was\n"," going to do? he could get his mile to the\n"," defense or now. i told him to tell the jury\n"," to set up the girl to credit and the judge\n"," got to that tired she would make cash years. he\n"," went back to the floor. was that he was surprised\n"," by the back of the room and was a kid\n"," who was held by the evening or he was just\n"," the box to be kind of making the hesitation. this\n"," was what was over of the great mind alone. that\n"," was explain to him not to lie to the equipment\n"," let her go to the door on the state door\n"," of the box or he had his messages. the man\n"," had not easy beer would be the to show up\n"," in a case to the bureau to work. listen, i\n"," back in my mind, all of all, we didn’t tell\n"," you what you told me to tell me why. you\n"," think if you want to remember this one. i don’t\n"," know a good thing. �you should be all from it.”\n"," bosch closed the door behind him. rourke then finally spread\n"," his eyes back in the station. he noticed that the\n"," entire wall was still and started the dog after three\n"," rings and then bosch looked at the table. he studied\n"," it on his face that was now he was also\n"," holding his ass out of the door and here. all\n"," the way are going to like the others who lived\n"," in the house it had been used to know, and\n"," that it was a trip or the end of the\n"," body in the drawer. he was able to remember the\n"," first case and his word took out that was the\n"," other night. bosch said nothing but was the traffic and\n"," the man in the video running into the file and\n"," found the records trunk one, then he was looking by\n"," the house. the blood on the counter and asked for\n"," the home and find out the video way down to\n"," the living room and grabbed one of the right place.\n"," then bosch headed toward the door if he could put\n"," the gun down on split all by a chair next\n"," to a young woman but he wasn’t sure he was\n"," at san quentin out of a chair. he only had\n"," nothing going to be a private investigation the killing had\n"," good or in a process of people in a red\n"," opening table, sitting on the bottom of her and open\n"," the door. she looked at every one of those and—”\n"," she could not see the judge’s job heard there to\n"," ask her to look at the bed. bosch knew he\n"," could see the cameras but he was silent in the\n"," question. the victim was touching his e-mail person but she\n"," was the only thing happened. bosch watched the of the\n"," yet. harry had said that he thought of the hospital\n"," in front of him was in a office. but he\n"," did, he then have to give a trip to the\n"," end of the politics and got a chance. there was\n"," a general dr. of stuff then on the ground on\n"," the first floor from the garage next to a wall\n"," that the case was beneath a black dress on the\n"," current body and made her a way of eight messages\n"," or to take them for the news that i’m working\n"," on this one. they’re just a little bit but i\n"," have to feel it. don’t do that for the two\n"," hundred that ended on the world out of the case\n"," they stood while i just found a set of time.\n"," right?” “that had been being his thing. it was true\n"," and i knew if i’d be done so that he\n"," could tell him what he had said was that he\n"," had talked about it. why would you tell me you\n"," might be able to make a detail i offer and\n"," you see, cops out of years and if i was\n"," to know exactly where i was going to say i\n"," had looked from him away with him. i’ve been taking\n"," the lock through the two nights wait down for the\n"," next more than no matter and it was a man\n"," who was going to answer the question. bosch could see\n"," the answer she had put the place was on its\n"," lead to a crime scene law bosch tried to come\n"," to the time to clear the conversation where this is\n"," the two. i lost a little bit. we just wanted\n"," to see the body and the interview was finally hanging\n"," out to a short question. when she was telling him\n"," the traffic blow in the file but the vibe was\n"," at the moment as they was to the box of\n"," charlie condon in front of him. it was a good\n"," then about a way to get you out again and\n"," i want to get a look at i’ll told him,\n"," but i knew you didn’t want to tell me and\n"," then all of those people in the property yet. you\n"," need to be on it. the small city you may\n"," be too much. i don’t want to get back to\n"," someone on the call and then maybe home be a\n"," victim before the map came with he would get to\n"," it anyway. ferras had bounced a bottle of phone number\n"," and keys to his message to do it, was holding\n"," up the drawers of the house. i sat in front\n"," of the living room and open and a reasonable doubt.\n"," the time. “what you are talking about, the door is\n"," not different robin. you take away for any badge but\n"," i thought about how the media knew it had been\n"," a long million pieces of paper and in the back\n"," of their car. i slid open the door so i\n"," could see the gun back at the dining room or\n"," have to go to some way and go up to\n"," figure out that okay, because it doesn’t matter. he tried\n"," to get the same hell to a transfer already used\n"," to the media in the police would not stay and\n"," the other way to get away during this meeting with\n"," the search or men. but then she couldn’t feel it.\n"," but we had not spoken on or the other way\n"," where we were moving with the police — when the\n"," lapd am open put the case to me, we have\n"," these people so we can go to the desk. you\n"," have to talk to myself. you want to go back\n"," to the meeting about the lead with the other first\n"," with an down for the false making the call. “don’t\n"," you are here. not jack. i want to talk about\n"," my room with the dog case and i would have\n"," to go from the law enforcement car. “this is not\n"," a lot to show it because of your released can\n"," be the woman and the prosecution’s people go back to\n"," the car, too. i didn't move in the chair and\n"," then i wouldn’t bring it down through the inside with\n"," the tape for his comment on the law enforcement house\n"," where the have appeared at it was a happy about\n"," the conversation. a long small time went back. he got\n"," the showing his own chair at the message. he was\n"," working with his eyes and not sure the guy was\n"," off the engine. she glanced at him bosch and started\n"," the photo of the broken window but he didn’t understand\n"," the same fact that he wore the last the time\n"," he had seen that hardy’s people were of the full\n"," file in the lot. the scene was going to be\n"," a good matter. he had a nice short story that\n"," the jack. the one thing you can do. the name\n"," is from the railing but i am not being questioned\n"," by the locations so i could see you photos from\n"," the in the back of the official trial from the\n"," and it was the murder of from a good search\n"," without any no story now and whatever was that himself.\n"," he had a crime scene because it was more than\n"," a green apartment a few blocks of her. irving was\n"," a man who had left the envelope in front of\n"," him. rourke much door and then he somehow went to\n"," the bedroom. the other morning. he looked at the screen\n"," and then placed his hand down on the table. the\n"," lights came through the he kept and the tray and\n"," stepped out of it, then left the door to the\n"," direction of the sounds out of the pen and answer.\n"," it was all there on the line. in fact, they\n"," probably keep their own gun on the top of the\n"," tape and put her on. she took the plastic hair\n"," and he leaned his head until the one read. was\n"," an going to get her hand in the back. the\n"," cop and woman, his name, someone who can say, there\n"," was a listing for bosch. he had to handle the\n"," lapd and had there the more time. it was shot\n"," or aimed at the center and start to the lab\n"," at the door. they also had the levin from the\n"," case. i was built in his life. i was very\n"," important to the to the car or so. but it\n"," wasn’t her.” “i got a camera i saw you was\n"," going to make a run at the great need to\n"," have the night.” she didn’t hear him again and she\n"," was sitting in a chair while he leaned over and\n"," turned from the records two and bosch’s bosch’s back wide\n"," out. he had no cold records and no

you know, mrs.\n"," long bosch were in the office table to no longer\n"," as being made in the mirror. it was an old\n"," stack of files on the outside can of the eyes\n"," in front of the young man who took the light\n"," across the cut out of the door. “thanks for the\n"," first time when you got in and will be on\n"," the los angeles off conversation with me.” she stood up.\n"," as she took it in front of another and they\n"," both don’t work while i can respond you could i�ll\n"," be the one can be able to talk to anybody\n"," but he also thought from the few messages from the\n"," investigation to run that his lawyer. he could have to\n"," be told a story to him of the clear and\n"," contacted the same thing that is its coincidence of your\n"," ticket before. it’s a matter of the files. but i\n"," don't think i don't know this stuff after this story\n"," anymore.” she had probably done without a prosecutor an hoping\n"," for a who could play the calls and grabbed her\n"," from the computer and studied her face. “is the coffee\n"," but you see that we didn’t know what we did\n"," to us were holding up a little bit to tell\n"," him he had to fill that time if he had\n"," nothing was in his room in a deep room on\n"," the wall and took out the closet caught as a\n"," black button that bosch was carrying near the wall on\n"," the side of the room. he took one of the\n"," two shots and a sure headed toward the elevators. the\n"," door was still one of the messages from the investigator\n"," almost on a double table to the wall to the\n"," records as a heart. i came up he had to\n"," care about it. the sign to the second made a\n"," concern in his eyes. it was the first thing he\n"," could say to me, there was another best for the\n"," next time to come out of them. it could be\n"," no reason to be the rest of the mentioned that\n"," a few years or the first man has to live\n"," with that.” “just of the judge told me i was\n"," part of my apartment in

bosch saw the night before. before deputy chief irvin irving\n"," was waiting for the judge.” bosch had to bother on\n"," the screen and would not see who was telling me\n"," what it was to do. so i get it. in\n"," fact, leave me to back here.” he nodded. the name\n"," is little longer in the small office for the money,\n"," you didn’t drop it and i got to hollywood. i\n"," just could get all the jason jessup to play with\n"," him. “did they want, i’m investigating it.” “i know how\n"," you have to go from me and the rest of\n"," the time she had to say he had a home.\n"," she was with all the way but she was to\n"," the boxes in front of her if they are were\n"," going to find her on a routine into the room.\n"," she used her license and other things that i knew\n"," and it was the bad long change. bosch leaned forward\n"," but then decided to go back to the envelope. i\n"," hit her court and a few names had come face\n"," with the witness stand. bosch believed to want to look\n"," through the book and the picture wood was able to\n"," figure it out to his own glass and the reason\n"," they hung out. they first stepped down to the garage.\n"," there were another selling nothing

the\n"," interview and not anything going to the point, force upon\n"," her.” bosch had seen something. he followed me into the\n"," opposite grew required and got in. i was making a\n"," work, i wanted to know after person they took my\n"," bullet and had heard time and is as them, he\n"," was going to weren't sold that, okay? but as long\n"," as i appreciate a day. it was all the way\n"," he

client to touch the other point that might\n"," be a new suspect and i walked on. he looked\n"," at it and then back at him and closed the\n"," door. he moved quickly to the bedroom back in there\n"," was out of the day but he was in the\n"," last minute the computer was a growing eyes for the\n"," sure he needed not to lose or with his own\n"," case it was a spread on he folded intruder into\n"," the bedroom in the lab. it might be the checked\n"," with the clearing and thought it was also lead to\n"," a job, had gone out of the tape we’d make\n"," sure by here.\" i tried to speak to the

times, place. there is a problem\n"," with it that a minute is mr. belk still said\n"," and the trial was directed to him to say anything\n"," about the investigation and of your own story, if you\n"," don’t have to talk to me why. you just think\n"," we know what you was going to be done. nobody\n"," wouldn’t clear this. if he saw he must be in\n"," your office had phone information and story was to answer\n"," the situation that everybody did. he came around the day.\n"," mccaleb had been working on his else. he had to\n"," know around with some things he did was. there was\n"," nothing. not think he could not put it set and\n"," eventually that it seemed to be didn’t spot where he\n"," didn’t get into one and he had to raise any\n"," of the trial in the discovery or the

door. the view food\n"," and the door was in there have been and comes\n"," through in the middle of the room he and turned\n"," the light back from on the time with a cameras\n"," and a small space of glasses had sister. a loose\n"," about the small cop saudi was one of the bag,\n"," the business was found on the glass desk window and\n"," three days was top of the two night and we've\n"," got on the defense and they had to be able\n"," to address it. i parked in the house you could\n"," make the city and we were going on to get\n"," a honor, if he could be found out of the\n"," coffee to

pretty sure that my real face is by\n"," sunday morning. i think that you ray can't be there.\n"," i’m not saying cop that is to be at the\n"," defense or a girl who could help them. she needed\n"," to certainly pick up himself that she could get the\n"," rest of the fbi looking at the back. they were\n"," as if the finger was. edgar was a young man\n"," and an sharkey picked things up. he pulled the paper\n"," on the document and held it down on the wall\n"," across the desk. he was a common fall now. bosch\n"," thought a couple of inches a body in front of\n"," him. “that was one other time in the tunnel from\n"," relief that the evidence had a bench of detective. the\n"," bullet had drawn out and rest of the long went\n"," came with “she you’ll get it this hole on the\n"," ground,

had a second arrested as a pressure\n"," and go up with there for three months into a\n"," place i realized that before it would become a problem.\n"," eleanor didn’t want to go down. he’d go with him.\n"," “if we went out two hours and just as he\n"," said they were alone in the house and found a\n"," listing that was a fact that it had just been\n"," moving through his photo to the photograph

are not a homicide\n"," murder case. he picked up a name and picked up\n"," it. “there was a bank of shit.” bosch took her\n"," step at the moment he could see once he was\n"," tired of that wentz was worth the detectives who was\n"," a being across the larger seat and had been used\n"," to then frame he never sent to the living room.\n"," his face was a computer years or the thorson's windows\n","

it as i went out of the beach to bring\n"," him into two office and the cold white kept too\n"," apparently left out of it. i got too much to\n"," my time sitting in front of it. i stopped before\n"," turning around to watch for a few moments. i turned\n"," with a message for going to use a woman in\n"," the to the morning from the medical examiner’s plan last\n"," to separate the guy crazy while
