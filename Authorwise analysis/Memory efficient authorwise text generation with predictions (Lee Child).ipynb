and the dead guy came out\n"," of the table and fallen and stopped and then reacher\n"," stepped away and pressed the jeep in the front and\n"," looked at the trail of paper in the sun, and\n"," then he relaxed to her. her hair was silent. she\n"," was maybe ten seconds away from him and her face\n"," on the closet steps was still under his neck, with\n"," the shotgun bouncing against the back of his finger. it\n"," was deserted. reacher stayed still for the first time. he\n"," asked, ‘why wouldn’t i?\" \"you told you to find your\n"," door.’ ‘that is in the car.’ ‘i just don't want\n"," you to pick it up and wait for you to\n"," figure out if you’re the military ever who you can.\n"," and i want to tell me what i know.\" \"i\n"," don't know. i want to get a look at that?”\n"," i shrugged. “not good. i don't want to check the\n"," sort of thing. and you need to check your job\n"," at a particular day, and then they can't stick around\n"," too loud to see the bureau's problem in the same\n"," two. she was still worried. she was already awake. she\n"," was awake and alert and hard. her mouth was quiet.\n"," she was wearing a heavy leather coat and a black\n"," leather shirt on the chain. he could feel them taking\n"," a pair of air. we had the gun in the\n"," plastic position to check the initials to the next list\n"," of the local records for a time and start up\n"," here,\" he said. \"when do you want to help you,\n"," right?” “they could be in and out, probably. i have\n"," to stop the fifth of a week while you can\n"," tell it i know how many times like you can\n"," do what you can do.\" reacher nodded. \"i think we\n"," do some kind of an abrams in the wrong place.\n"," no connection from joe. but it would be a mistake.\n"," that was clear. it was a big guy, young, and\n"," tired and shiny and fresh and standing all over the\n"," city. they heard the end of the motor running and\n"," the enormous spray burst into the walls and the rear\n"," wheels came out of the squad room and swung across\n"," the door and checked and parked on the floor, and\n"," reacher was dressed in a long white name and a\n"," white jeans and a black tie. a light with a\n"," rack high, even after a mass of perfume. like a\n"," lobby. no traffic. no point in a tiny pad of\n"," heavy trees, but it was like a tv car in\n"," the shadows. the road was probably the same as the\n"," nebraska burst through the air, and if he put it\n"," in the cell. the light was a small gesture but\n"," it was a large grocery track painted to a pair\n"," of smoke and white paint behind it. “where are you\n"," going to do?' he asked. \"because i figure you are\n"," a great theory to share the mail. and you should\n"," call it. you need to stay here and get some\n"," other one to get a look at us like a\n"," cloud for the same time. but i guess he's heading\n"," for a different call at the same time you’re worried.\n"," i need the cops to use the old pd and\n"," my daughter in the same tree. i had a man's\n"," weapons in my head. she was on my way back\n"," in the dark near the driveway. the bed was locked.\n"," the door was still running. the clock at the big\n"," guy said he had been in a place. a small\n"," blow in a dirty chevy in the cold. the third\n"," time he was still awake and dark and slow. he\n"," was all in his face. the ground was thin. he\n"," was staring at reacher and picked up the cassette for\n"," a long time. he watched the doors swing inside and\n"," hit the bell and followed the fire door. the sedan\n"," came out. he saw the land out of the gate.\n"," then he heard nothing doing. he hauled the truck off\n"," and swung the door open. peterson took his shoe off\n"," and put it in it. waited for them to bring\n"," them off and check the way back to the marine\n"," city. and we don’t know whether to see it.’ the\n"," guy said, ‘you can go to a lot of things,\n"," because they’re tracking you in the service with a team\n"," of paper and a place you went to reality. the\n"," woman said, ‘there’s a dog on the fourth. it’s a\n"," guy who gets somewhere to say, and i’ll be to\n"," get the keys out of your own room. not of\n"," the army, where i’d have won money. i wasn't sure\n"," whether they were in the same day. i asked her\n"," about the short message and said, “why not?' froelich asked.\n"," “why would they get a chance and the threat comes\n"," in and he can say it, or you know where\n"," i mean? but the name is dirty and the chief\n"," of a waste of innocent people. the first vehicle was\n"," going to die. they were working the correct money and\n"," be used to an undercover story. i was a very\n"," good man, but i want to get a ride in\n"," the day. you don't see anything out of his way.\"\n"," the guy came up with a long revolver and a\n"," pair of hair hanging in the air. no noise in\n"," the air with a stack of money. no sign of\n"," a farm police department. i took a long guy out\n"," of her own seat. i was dressed in a clock\n"," and then i could see footsteps thinking hard, and played\n"," in my face. the light ticked and the head gleamed\n"," red and damp. the air was a wide glass building,\n"," maybe forty. the house was dark. it was still bright.\n"," there were four windows on the sidewalk, all six resting\n"," down in a silent angle, and the engine was filling\n"," with a yellow laminate and a ragged concrete machine. a\n"," new guy. similar weight and bone chatter had been pulsing\n"," and settled into solid steel. there was a small sedan\n"," and a white blacktop and a blue leather suit and\n"," a long leather jacket. he was wearing a leather shirt,\n"," but he was holding her forearms going. she was carrying\n"," a plastic wire in a huge leather jacket. he turned\n"," and stood still and stretched and hooked his knees into\n"," a drawer and heard the sound of a blank man\n"," standing where he was going. a tiny car, no formal\n"," square cars. there was a sliding door in the hallway.\n"," the rear tires had a bar of yellow light on\n"," the floor. the engine was locked and the door was\n"," still running. the thickset man on the left. the door\n"," swung open and holland stepped out and closed the door\n"," behind me. the guy who had felt that the shower\n"," was still still by her eyes, and every crown vic\n"," had some reason that he was in a line. the\n"," body was a black man in a continuous municipal box.\n"," he was a big man. the bus was the same\n"," thing, and the other clock was quiet for a second.\n"," then the phone pulled up into the road. it raced\n"," out of the door. the ramp was closed. the car\n"," was all closed. the gravel was locked. it was a\n"," prison green car standing still on it. the screen was\n"," still on the side of the stall. the door bumped\n"," over to the guy and the woman’s face was still\n"," moving. then she drove herself to the ball on his\n"," right. then he stood still and listened. he saw the\n"," sound of a pair of white light on the other.\n"," just a pair of guns. the bureau window peaked and\n"," stopped at the end of the room and walked back\n"," into the room. we were all in the back of\n"," the room. i saw it a hundred yards away from\n"," the side and the kitchen with a bottle of paper\n"," in the air. there was a new bruise in my\n"," pocket. the clock on the door was a big pause,\n"," but he took a short breath, and then the hole\n"," came out in a small bar outside the airport ,\n"," he thought. the woman with a long across led to\n"," a bar on the right. there was a dry figure\n"," in the dark. then he got back in the office\n"," and unwrapped the knife out of her holster. clamped the\n"," rifle. crept through the rear door. poulton was just in\n"," the cells. he could see footsteps on the floor. the\n"," rotor was made of khaki cotton. the clock was the\n"," same. he had a long black box and a roaring\n"," in his face. the leader was standing there in the\n"," darkness above the floor. he was looking at the sign\n"," of her watch. she was still smiling. she was quiet\n"," for a moment. \"you need the night. that's where she\n"," knew that? and she was a sign at the first\n"," time he woke up and put the safety back in\n"," his pocket and used it to wipe the right eye\n"," after him. he was carrying a chain of paper on\n"," his face. it was a random woman named orozco, which\n"," was for damn sure. he was there, looking for the\n"," exotic gloves. he heard a door open and feel like\n"," a cotton tan and a big click. he saw her\n"," drive around for a second and then he slid out\n"," through the rear door and the sound of the road\n"," in his mind and the lights tore off. then he\n"," tried to watch the breakfast machine. she looked pretty worried\n"," about what the hell she had ever seen. i said,\n"," “i should go back. you could do it.\" the woman\n"," said. \"they were doing the sort of thing you would\n"," happen to do to. the house is a thin investigator\n"," of the chicago officers. it’s too cold to call her\n"," all this time.\" \"i think i can check it for\n"," us.\" \"find out what you do to you?' \"can i\n"," get a turn here, right? i'm going to be in\n"," a hotel, right?” “no,” i said. “like that little name\n"," within a week. maybe he was a good guy. and\n"," he was proved easy. he had spent a week in\n"," the other room. i heard the bullet stand out. i\n"," was sitting on the stairs. i had no big pressure\n"," in his hand. no socks. i pulled the hook out\n"," of my left hand and looked at the car in\n"," the chamber. the driver was a small place. i could\n"," see the shiny bar on the second of the window\n"," opposite. the bridge was still talking. it was blowing the\n"," length of the ceiling and a slow door snapped back\n"," to my back and stepped around to the kitchen door.\n"," a big voice, damp and quiet. the bus came in\n"," and they were the same way as a fashion below\n"," the afternoon. the world was full of grey. regular size\n"," in a neat green tube reacher could use the door\n"," outside. it was a foot taller than a turn of\n"," the shower and the glow of the north of the\n"," car. he got in the room. nobody to say the\n"," state or their people. and they had the after of\n"," the secret pd and he would be on the exact\n"," night in the past. he had a bunch of photographs\n"," on the floor and a woman who had to have\n"," taken the motor to the table that was a big\n"," old guy going to be expected to check the action.\n"," he knew it was a cautious job.’ i wasn’t sure\n"," where the cop would have started. so i was sure\n"," he was seeing it. it had nothing to say. he\n"," guessed he had been a home from the start. he\n"," had been in for a spell. but she was wrong.\n"," she was a party or new york or the army\n"," in the state of the city in the future. there\n"," was no traffic standing in the hallway. just a pleasant\n"," line of being about a couple of times than i\n"," was just the best of them to do before. i\n"," could hear the faint glow of the vehicle on the\n"," slope. his stick was pretty hot the same way i\n"," was going. the sandy guy in the suit was watching\n"," his eyes. he was ready with the car to survive\n"," the same thing they would have. the best thing was\n"," to be a new system. the motor clicked and the\n"," motor came in and the cars came out to be\n"," plenty of weapons. the phone was a pretty very good\n"," camera out of the united dollars in the centre of\n"," the truck. she was in a gray suit and it\n"," was a small stream of paper. there were flags on\n"," the walls. the bar was an office tank. in the\n"," air had been occupied. some two men carrying the second\n"," eight drivers on a stream of targets. and they were\n"," in the start. reacher was in the room and he\n"," stepped out into the centre of the corner of the\n"," airport doors and bounced the length of the red ring\n"," on the steps and checked the wheel and the bullets\n"," and the stiff new slid ford was showing a hundred\n"," miles above the gloom. or the grand club is a\n"," stream of time. so i knew it was a man\n"," called sorenson with something. but he was in a cassette\n"," holster and a big black blue room, and a metal\n"," cross space with a metallic glow in the front door\n"," that reacher heard a light off in the distance of\n"," the bus and the jeep came in behind me. then\n"," the guy came out with a pile of yellow light\n"," on the wall of the stone building behind it. he\n"," slowed and turned and put his hand on the trigger.\n"," he knocked on the drawer and laid his left hand\n"," on the third seat, in the empty silence. picked up\n"," the gun and pushed it onward into the mud. he\n"," pushed the door shut. he heard the door open and\n"," the two men leave, all the way out of the\n"," black light. there were other television thumping on the top\n"," wall of the exit floor, white and the truck moved\n"," away. the bright lights showed up in the air. he\n"," put the blade carefully in the chain. the heavy chevy\n"," was standing in the sun. he was on the right.\n"," he was the same. reacher was sitting on the floor.\n"," the air was deserted. the truck was full of traffic\n"," and the five guys were the same thing as a\n"," vacant lot. the hard security entrance was lit up by\n"," the moonlight and the fresh air from the sand of\n"," the car. a large black sedan in the air. the\n"," car was still on the far side of the truck.\n"," the driver felt a third tape in the bedroom and\n"," the driver stuck his head in the air. i felt\n"," a few feet in the air. i sat still in\n"," the room. i waited. the lawyer said, ‘that’s the army\n"," to help you.” “you think?’ ‘i don’t want to talk\n"," about your case. i have a professional flight of sight.\n"," so now i might have seen that one of them\n"," had done it. not a guy that would have been\n"," ordered to be blown off in a big lightning case.\n"," i was so much in the same room, because it\n"," was a pretty late version of the world, because he\n"," had spent a few times in a new york city,\n"," in the morning. because he could have had a lot\n"," of cash in his mind and more than a long,\n"," long moment. he was dressed at his staff room. he\n"," had a long step. he stood still. he said, ‘i\n"," can’t shoot them here for a year, because you would\n"," be out of the room and pick up the money\n"," for the last time they were going to talk to\n"," him if they wouldn’t have a boy to get a\n"," mistake. no cops, no connection in the val cup on\n"," the wall and stared at him. 'i'm looking for the\n"," family boy with you, ok? i never told you where\n"," you are, you know what you are doing to you?'\n"," the employer said. \"how did you make the women get\n"," a answer. and you’ll have a lot of life in\n"," the army. that’s what this isn't in the house to\n"," worry about. you don't know where they do.” reacher nodded.\n"," “i have a ride in the military on the next\n"," floor and eat the hoover office and check my telephone\n"," number. then i went in the room. i rolled in\n"," on the ground. i rolled into the gap and used\n"," the other tape to get the beer number. he got\n"," up and leaned in and said, “i don’t know,” i\n"," said. she said, “no, a job of spend your life\n"," on a small of a thing. so i won't find\n"," the guy in the house. but i think your guess\n"," is i was going to be an fbi address in\n"," a man's girl without a fine name. because she had\n"," a man's body in the kitchen space. it was a\n"," big man, and the faint vehicle was still on the\n"," crown vic’s sofa. he heard the bolts come out of\n"," the motel barn. it felt like a guy called joe\n"," and was feeling the same thing as fast as the\n"," wad was going to be a thing. the left-hand of\n"," a double screen. no signs of infantry numbers and the\n"," house would be a long part of it. but he\n"," wasn’t in the bars to pull a look at the\n"," strip in the gloom. but there was no traffic. no\n"," sound at all. no other one ticked straight through the\n"," second. the cop was in a complicated place. and the\n"," guy in the rifle was a guy called vaughan in\n"," the same story, because he was there, but he was\n"," hanging the same thing with one last way in the\n"," military. the message was a car and a different version\n"," of the first thing instead. but it was a smart\n"," way too fast. the road was a very new type\n"," of guy or the rest of the world is going\n"," to put him there and throw it in the back\n"," of the head, but then you got a damn long\n"," time. i'm not going to get away in the whole\n"," police department, and the same thing reacher had told him\n"," to go. he saw the maid say: i spent the\n"," first part of the way in the dark and the\n"," thump of the trees in the light. the hole was\n"," a man i could smell was better. it was a\n"," big guy with a wedding tube and a soft smile.\n"," raskin had been in the first man and stopped for\n"," the middle of the time when he came to their\n"," land. the phones were full of shoes. the house was\n"," roaring a little high on the back of a corner.\n"," the door opened and it was about an inch in\n"," the shadows. there was a blue sedan in the motel\n"," office. there was a new ford woman in the old\n"," room. two chairs. a public guard in the army. there\n"," was a man in the window with a foot on\n"," the floor and a ragged bottle of paper in the\n"," left-hand lane. it was about fifty yards from the far\n"," sidewalk before they passed the back corner of the room\n"," and stopped for a minute more in the air. he\n"," figured he would have its body run in a copy\n"," of a continuous brass farm. he would be able to\n"," assume he had been moving. they had been there. it\n"," was a big guy. plus a grand statement, a very\n"," small operation. the sound is too solid to be a\n"," little expensive. but you know whose family you're telling you\n"," to do that?\" the guy in the voice. reacher shook\n"," his head. \"and you know how hard you owe her\n"," about it. i was maybe a hundred thousand miles away\n"," in the day. he looked to be going to make\n"," out the car and make a big call on the\n"," car. it was a blank time and it was a\n"," long length of cork boards, and and cold. it was\n"," easy enough to be armed to the bottom of the\n"," wall of the left. the last three of them ran\n"," fast. the wind and the surface was very low enough\n"," to be louder. it was made of tiny thick plastic\n"," light. the left-hand was a shallow angle and the heavy\n"," lights were still open. the door was parked in the\n"," air. the sound was already full of blue with a\n"," substantial database bell. he moved fast. headed back to the\n"," doorway and put his hands on the back of the\n"," floor. then he put the rifle back in my pocket\n"," and followed the machine off. got the contents up and\n"," passed the others inside. i didn’t see the numbers from\n"," it. i was looking at him for a while. he\n"," was in a large white room on the east, on\n"," the curb. the door was a dull laminate bar and\n"," the sky was empty. reacher walked the length of the\n"," room and checked the street behind it. then he drove\n"," slightly to the line. he glimpsed the wrong room. the\n"," lights were still folded in the doorway, but it was\n"," a big ten minutes later, to stop the same guy\n"," from the road and parked in the car. twenty miles\n"," and then parked and eased back north to the diner.\n"," the other was still in the windshield, within a hundred\n"," yards of the truck. that was clear. they were a\n"," mile away, thirty yards ahead of him. he was in\n"," a thick leather chair and reacher was staring at him.\n"," reacher stood up with the first thing a fraction of\n"," a mile and the first part of the time he\n"," was willing to go up in the shadows. reacher could\n"," see them before, in the middle of the point. it\n"," was a wide stream of paper with a staff car.\n"," the world was empty. the two guys were in the\n"," house, and he knew that. reacher was in a hotel,\n"," but he knew where reacher had been in the lawyer's\n"," house. the lawyer walked after me. i took my breath.\n"," drove away. the guy in the way the door opened\n"," and he got back in my car. i saw her\n"," go. she was a guy in a different silence. he\n"," was on the same bed, watching the thick morning farm\n"," and then ten miles ahead. he put his hand on\n"," the floor and said, “i don’t know. i could do\n"," that for what it was. i looked at the guy\n"," in the silence. she was still in her chair and\n"," she was dressed and jammed and smelled of dust and\n"," bone and gas and sprayed and brown lights on the\n"," floor. it was a huge sound, black, not like it\n"," had been something to be fired up and part of\n"," the same anonymous gate. the door was closed. the driver\n"," got away and turned off his foot and held out\n"," the truck long enough to take the sharp old tape\n"," out of the battered kitchen and the background driver switched\n"," her coffee. she waited for me to pay the impression\n"," like she was looking for him. \"we need to understand\n"," it in the world today. i don’t know what they\n"," could do to me in the morning.’ reacher nodded, like\n"," she intended to understand when she said, ‘i think i\n"," need to do. i could get a cup of paper\n"," on. i was sitting up on the table somewhere in\n"," the back of the room. the view was a solid\n"," path in the dirt with a red plastic briefcase on\n"," the sofa at the wheel and then got out. it\n"," was a pair of energy. the woman was in a\n"," bar of brass cabinets, a tangle of shock and ammunition.\n"," there was a navy big guy in a room with\n"," an empty line in the far floor of the lobby\n"," nearest to the gate, and both chairs were opening and\n"," padded and full of dense paper. it was the same\n"," thing as a hundred yards closer, and a hundred and\n"," fifty pounds of paper in a oak block rover i\n"," heard the road stove cloud up like a savage cellar\n"," garage and drove hard and checked through the headlight beams,\n"," and then reacher saw the guy even all kinds of\n"," times all over the school house, and he knew in\n"," the next night, and the roads were moving. so the\n"," second place was an inch away. he stopped dead and\n"," looked at him and walked back to his room. \"i\n"," want to believe i think so.\" \"the truth is that\n"," it's like that, right?” “you still know who you need\n"," to do?\" \"they know where the hell you did to\n"," you?\" the tech smiled at him. \"we've got a better\n"," word than you know, you can assume we find the\n"," possibility of which means that's the kind of thing you\n"," get. the whole thing will be a good guy or\n"," a piece of coffee. but it wasn't a good place\n"," to be worth a mistake. he came out of the\n"," interior and pulled the safety off and went back to\n"," the car. five miles later the door was still still\n"," and hard and silent. it was like a giant diesel\n"," station and the wind was hidden by a short angle.\n"," it was a nightmare. the to was a new surveillance\n"," place in the secret war line. the white agent came\n"," out of the woods and folded it out of his\n"," pocket. they waited. i heard a black glow in the\n"," air. the bus was part of the computer sergeant. the\n"," old guy. the tire screen was parked in the white\n"," shadows. the light was all the way up to a\n"," lonely alley and backed into a table and took a\n"," look at the register outside. the driver came back and\n"," pulled it up and left the shower on the corner\n"," of the middle of the truck and steered myself out,\n"," very carefully and forth in the tub and the shotgun\n"," outside in the sheriff’s department. he retraced the doors onto\n"," the concrete road. then he waited in the darkness. reacher\n"," saw it on the gravel. it was a loud framed\n"," square item in the traffic doorway, making the cell phone\n"," look like a regular shape. he got a box of\n"," fresh snow. i could see the guy in the motel\n"," chair. it was a pretty good piece of blood and\n"," fabric in his face. the hand itself was the same\n"," size as the fbi bus he had seen from the\n"," middle of the area, and it was a solid breeze\n"," and the door settled and his eyes crashed over and\n"," the same tires opened and he could smell footsteps in\n"," the same item that the train was ordered to jerk\n"," through the gloom and take a look, and leave it\n"," on the floor. but he's a question of his brother.\n"," i could smell a short man, and the old guy\n"," on the right was still for nothing they could do.\n"," he stepped forward. the door was closed. the screen was\n"," still on the curb. he drove around the road and\n"," started the other door through the door and turned and\n"," backed out of the house and found a small wooden\n"," window bolted to the bottom wall of the family had\n"," to be all the way back to the blind road.\n"," the bathroom was a thick pause and then the engine\n"," was closed. the truck dropped to a little, and then\n"," he clicked off and started walking and making it in\n"," the same length of the bed. he had almost been\n"," in a desk in the front seat, built with solid\n"," light, and no weapon and scars on the hallway frame,\n"," and a little bright and black and thick and cold.\n"," then he walked backward and let the one against the\n"," top of the office and check the end of the\n"," neck and call a boy of a blow from a\n"," chance. so now i guess i'm not sure my guess\n"," is i don’t know. and i was told a problem.\n"," we were still in and out. i wasn’t sure if\n"," i was taking a look. i didn't understand it with\n"," the first one all over the phone and walked down\n"," to the kitchen. he was wearing a black suit. the\n"," tires on the right was visible ahead of him. the\n"," radio was still still next to him. the tires were\n"," bright. the guy looked straight at him. he was wearing\n"," a short black suit and a damp item and a\n"," black tree was a thin front path of the yard\n"," with a new bruise on his face. the sound of\n"," the tires was three hundred yards away and a foot\n"," deep. a little closer to the side of the building\n"," was a small pick-up store in the distance of a\n"," broken desk and a rolling player in the window with\n"," a mug of paper alone. he stopped and started walking.\n"," then he pulled his gun out of his pocket and\n"," turned his head and held it in the water for\n"," a second and then walked into the living room. he\n"," had a pair of paper. he had a long sheet\n"," of paper. the house was still warm and silent. the\n"," wind was thrown out. the same room was deserted. it\n"," was a little dark but more than the law before.\n"," the old agent said, ‘i guess you think we’re going\n"," to have to do it.\" \"i just asked you if\n"," i was telling you it.\" \"what was the hoths with\n"," a stolen target. the the lawyer was staring at him\n"," as she fell back in the car and i hit\n"," his knees and opened the glove bag and said, “i’m\n"," going to get out of there?” “i didn’t know what\n"," he did about it. i guessed he was in a\n"," long camp. his eye was already on his side, he\n"," was sitting in the back seat. he was dressed on\n"," a car, a neat smile. a black white yellow shirt\n"," was a hundred and fifty miles. total of five miles\n"," a mile of the next thing in the head of\n"," the chair was a stout guy in the head, and\n"," the guy from the street ticked away from the same\n"," house as a farm club. i stepped back to the\n"," hallway and took out a fresh length of paper of\n"," open light. i figured he had been getting up in\n"," the cold either, but he wasn’t looking for him. she\n"," knew what he would need to do to say. so\n"," he said, ‘so?’ ‘i don’t know. but i’m not in\n"," the world, you know, too. and i don’t like it.”\n"," i stared at her. the woman said, ‘the lawyer at\n"," the way if it was a million million dollars on\n"," the desk was a ford service rate in the sky\n"," with a brass light between the stairs and the waves\n"," beating against the laminate and the rotor tone on his\n"," head was still coming out of her face. the door\n"," was still still on the table and the car was\n"," soaked and smelled of paint and blue paper. it was\n"," a standard problem in a real message on the guy\n"," in the service in the last way of the

the same\n"," time that he had gotten to it. he moved straight\n"," across the elevator. the train was gone. the big guy\n"," started walking. the train was still asleep. the sandy woman\n"," nodded and waved her, slowly. he took a breath. \"i\n"," need to know where the truth was. i don't know.\n"," i guess these guys are not a big system in\n"," the army. they were the only way to be a\n"," waste of stuff else. he got a ride to the\n"," hoover area and carried it up to the motel, but\n"," worst time the next thing was possible it was a\n"," good version of her life. reacher could see her from\n"," the ground. he had a magazine up and smoke and\n"," folded a tight u-turn over the shotgun and east to\n"," the motel door. vaughan took the rifle off her mouth.\n"," she was wearing jeans and a dark shirt. he was\n"," in a small corridor from a narrow tunnel outside the\n"," hotel and open ice and there were doors mounted against\n"," the driveway so reacher could hear the door open and\n"," make a number look at her line from the windshield,\n"," as close as she could, but she was working with\n"," her blond own. she knew that, and she said she\n"," could stay for a few months and then i said,\n"," ‘what?’ peterson said nothing. i said, ‘i want to come\n"," out with me.\" \"what did you do? hey, you haven’t\n"," met you in the personal at all. they were on\n"," the head of the road, lying around in the air.\n"," the ground was still still there. the land was still.\n"," a small bus and a giant plastic bottle and a\n"," blue shirt and a thin cap of black shirt on\n"," the counter. the first man was standing there, glancing up\n"," through the front door. pulled the screwdriver off and stepped\n"," inside. i heard the rifle for a second. then i\n"," snapped it round and found the motor holes. found a\n"," bottle of coffee in a pair of green. he saw\n"," his badge in the ties. he had been waiting for\n"," me. he had been settled to the map. he saw\n"," the next revolver lift past the ice and the diner\n"," jumped and kicked and bounced and came out to rest\n"," in front of him. he saw the truck in the\n"," small corner. the stairs. the room was still running. the\n"," pilot was working again on the curb on the floor.\n"," he was still in the mouth of the door in\n"," the hallway itself. he pushed it in and dragged the\n"," other way over the desk. he leaned against the transmission\n"," frame. hit the safety off and stepped into the car.\n"," he was holding his finger in his shoulder until he\n"," saw the driver push it after him. he saw them\n"," go. the bullet ended up moving, and a single sedan\n"," was still in a corner of the block and the\n"," road above the flames were still in the air. the\n"," lights had the size of a military industrial at what\n"," reacher had been going. there were a faint white wooden\n"," exit mounted on the sidewalk. the four men rode in\n"," there. the cop reached to the car. it was a\n"," guy on the floor, which time it was all of\n"," them a hundred yards out, it was a big good\n"," glance at the back of the rifle and a plain\n"," sedan linked to a lot of paper. the tires were\n"," roaring clean. which means he was pushing a formal animal\n"," off.\" \"and i don’t know,” i said. “not all. just\n"," trying to think about who he is. but i need\n"," a lot of questions. i don’t know.’ reacher said nothing.\n"," reacher said, ‘you’re not just a whole lot more than\n"," anything else, not yet. it was a big ugly part\n"," for a second and then it was smaller than it\n"," would be been on the other end. this was a\n"," secret man. i made it to the phone and held\n"," it up again with my window lightly against the wheel\n"," and the lock followed it. the woman grinned at himself\n"," on the wall. she said, ‘the fun is going to\n"," be a lot of the day. if we run to\n"," the new guy’s mind i need to carry her ass\n"," in. i know the guy who gets out.\" the receptionist\n"," was still there a better time. then he moved her\n"," chin into his head and saw her lift his mouth.\n"," he looked up at him. \"you need to do it,\"\n"," he said. \"it was a hundred acres. the world has\n"," a waste of people in vegas. they can’t remember what\n"," a hell of a ride in the world for a\n"," white car, for a while. he balled the rifle and\n"," saw the car coming down from the night. it was\n"," a thick blue sedan, a little visible, put on the\n"," bus tower. the owner was in the air between the\n"," screen and the lounge and opened the lid. pulled off\n"," the desk. the place was a solid sign that had\n"," been occupied. it was a wave of shock that would\n"," have happened a little longer than before. he was a\n"," good way from the station house in the movies. the\n"," rooms in the left-hand of felt the ground had been\n"," sucked out of the air. i used it to drive\n"," back to the other end of the house and get\n"," himself a car in the dark and the hardware station\n"," in the back office were damp and shiny. it was\n"," a long time after they say he wasn’t headed for\n"," bed and then refused and thought about it. she took\n"," off her mouth. her wrists rattled into the long shelf\n"," of a dim hiss bolted to a metal page. the\n"," smell of metal was quiet. the truck was on the\n"," corner of the highway, pointing into the office of the\n"," main lane parking area. i turned around and knocked and\n"," lay there and watched the living room with the gun,\n"," and he moved fast, which was the same thing. in\n"," the same place. maybe not a new valley and i\n"," guessed he had taken a ride down. i was still\n"," wearing his daughter. all the way back in the night\n"," was a lot more than a minute. it was a\n"," quiet pair of dust. a second later a faint smudge\n"," in the air. the light on the personnel fell upright\n"," and the door whirred behind his face, heading as far\n"," as the forest siren looked up. 'you know who the\n"," fifth mujahideen is?” the cop said, “i need to get\n"," a couple of dollars in the cops. you knew the\n"," white unit is a party conference. you need to be\n"," in the first place. the individual is the same as\n"," it buys a million dollars in a plane. no kind\n"," of a lack of evidence for a good name in\n"," the crossroads. i felt like they were hoping to think\n"," about something, and the guys had a mistake. he had\n"," to be so bad to be halfway between groups and\n"," legs and chairs and distant doors and the building of\n"," the ground. the pickup was going to be painted some\n"," of the traffic that was not going to be someone\n"," else in the same time, because it's a cell call\n"," in the army, until the odds are my partner like\n"," that, and your guess is i need to come out.\n"," i think it’s a completely private problem in the army,”\n"," she said. “i know what you want to say. i\n"," want you to get in and i'll see you before.\n"," the cops will be a question of jail or here,\n"," and then you have her sister at least a couple\n"," of weeks too, and all we have to know. and\n"," you feel to stick on the first one,\" he said.\n"," \"so what about the question?\" he asked. \"no one is\n"," a bad thing. that’s the one i can be doing.\n"," you know, you think he came back to the two\n"," weeks and he kept hold of the rest of my\n"," life. then he turned right and headed back towards the\n"," kitchen. he was a private target. the lobby was cold.\n"," the air was still bright. the tide was still quiet\n"," and smooth. the black green sedan was showing up in\n"," the shadows. no time to stop a big man's bags\n"," in the railroad office and make a long look at\n"," the sky. there was no one in the dark. no\n"," evidence in the o club section. i swiveled on the\n"," lever and laid the other foot on the ground. the\n"," leader was in the right end of the motel store\n"," i had the first sentry next to the bullet ever\n"," wanted to get me back. i went out on to\n"," the bus and came out in a table. the seats\n"," were occupied. the vehicle was all empty. it was a\n"," corner of the south coast, with a closed sight behind\n"," her. reacher was twisted around in the face. it was\n"," on him. reacher felt the last guy in the head.\n"," the fourth man in the suit stepped alongside her. then\n"," reacher came back into the room. he heard the whine\n"," of the engine lights and the traffic beam settled awkwardly\n"," to the back of the office. the room was a\n"," small angle. that was the type of thing who were\n"," really aware of it. not very strong. his eyes, they\n"," would be in a crazy circle, and i could have\n"," gotten there so far to the right i would have\n"," seen the old guy a year ago. i think they\n"," had a fresh captain in the elevator for the same,\n"," but he had never hit a hold while they were\n"," putting the biggest option he was doing. he was trying\n"," to keep the paper up to the house, because i\n"," don't see it before.\" \"we should see that if you\n"," are, which is the way i do.’ sorenson nodded. ‘where’s\n"," the gun at the wheel. “you headed for the desk.\n"," this is probably going to be a joke with a\n"," cop. you need to see the view of the gate\n"," and they were carrying the same sounds that wouldn’t be\n"," a human in the world. for a million dollars. a\n"," lot of training or a bullet would be there. the\n"," sun was rolling on. the lights were still open. which\n"," was the size of the boxes in the warehouse if\n"," he reached the gate, and then then he checked the\n"," gray machine. the old guy was on the side of\n"," the bed outside the guest room. still and clean. she\n"," was carrying a fresh bottle of coffee. her elbows were\n"," clamped against the basement of his chest and bone with\n"," his fingers and opened his eyes with a single plastic\n"," cap on the bed, a little taller than he had\n"," seen, and there were many guys with the same thing\n"," on the platform. the phone guy, one of the guys\n"," in the car. all in the same night space the\n"," person had used before. he heard the glow of the\n"," office and the colt and a yellow key. the guy\n"," in the lights met his chair. he had a small\n"," silence on his face. he was staring at her. she\n"," was a small room and she had a hand in\n"," his face. 'that was the two of you in the\n"," service, on the other side. your brother is still in\n"," the army, and they knew the nature of the fbi.\n"," and they had made up the land at the lounge\n"," and had been out of the lot where i had\n"," last heard of me. i still was waiting. i could\n"," feel the woman in the face. i could see her\n"," and her daughter in the back of her eyes. i\n"," heard her smile go into his face. she finished her\n"," weight and tapped his chin. he felt it in his\n"," face, but he was facing a gesture and then a\n"," second of his face came out through the light. the\n"," crown vic was still in the hallway opposite it. he\n"," took off his hands and kissed her breathing. he waited\n"," in the mirror. she lifted it out of his ear.\n"," she carried it back to the window. she pulled himself\n"," up and studied his eyes. they lowered it and glanced\n"," straight at the desk without the phone and said, ‘i\n"," can’t see the right thing. i have to move on\n"," right now.” he nodded back out of the bank and\n"," saw a dusty dark black sedan through the night. the\n"," air was deserted. he was dressed like a clear leather\n"," jeans and a long white shirt and a black leather\n"," shirt, with a pair of water. no signs of people\n"," on the gate, to go. i could hear the house\n"," flash and pulled off our truck. i didn’t want to\n"," have to pass out the car and get the other\n"," guy in the car. you remember about the same guys.\n"," they were a lot more than a couple of miles\n"," away at the time he saw her haul off the\n"," diner from the office and talk to me, leaving the\n"," night. we let the last is all at all. it’s\n"," probably the same thing as a corporate list. and they\n","\n","\n","Writing to

house with a staff of his life and a different\n"," one. the trees were closed together. there was no place\n"," there, except a five more figure all day. then the\n"," second guard sat down next to the view between the\n"," ceiling. he pulled his flashlight to the wheel and watched\n"," the screen and accelerated all the way back to the\n"," building and stepped down the porch cabinet and found a\n"," kitchen behind a deep plastic chair and it chased the\n"," width of a new rental. the sound was all still\n"," on the move. reacher took a sheaf of coffee from\n"," the box. the distance was a

close and spun the door behind me, the room\n"," came out. the air was still dark. just a strong\n"," motel id on the station. the old man said, ‘i\n"," need to think about that. not in there.” “i

thick\n"," green. but it was all set close enough to put\n"," it in one side of his mind, and he forgot\n"," about it. \"you're looking for what you're going to do\n"," about your friend or you were

he\n"," had to. he had ignored people before.\" \"i think you\n"," need to do you here?” i nodded. i could have\n"," made me eat in the end, because i spent a\n"," few years doing anything about it at all.” he smiled.\n"," he said, ‘i can’t get a chance of two if\n"," i followed the date in the same face. i was\n"," sitting in a whole straight wall outside the front of\n"," the house and the sun on

don't\n"," want some defensive sense something.\" reacher nodded. \"i talked to\n"," me? she decided to wait. i missed a dog and\n"," told me to let them go in and get to\n"," the big marine agent and you need to assume we\n"," don't need to keep the set through anything, you could\n"," get up with the real guy in a flight of\n"," post in the movies. i want it to have a\n"," detective either, and i don't know. i think the army\n"," came in to find his own. so the guy will\n"," come in to leave us sitting out and leave them\n"," on the wheel. that’s the same thing as nice as\n"," that. so i don’t think i was about to do\n"," it for a few weeks and then walk away.\" \"because\n"," i don’t understand, you can sleep against me?’ ‘i want\n"," to do this in the army, because it’s time to\n"," be

right now, you know\n"," where they can.’ peterson said, “i’m sure we’ve made a\n"," lawyer. i've probably lost his mind, anyway. and they were\n"," a lot from a long time. he was wearing a\n"," black blue sweatshirt made of old white hair. a complicated\n"," white id folder built in the suit door. reacher closed\n"," the door behind him. he made it back to the\n"," house and tripped the cover of the button and the\n"," suit spilled out against the light and the wipers filled\n"," and vaughan had looked at the map. he was just\n"," in the light that it was pointing at the table.\n"," there was a small blue sedan on the left of\n"," his own. the staff of the transfer was in a\n"," maintenance lane, the office road, which the whole one was\n"," coming on. a soft white report. the sound itself was\n"," a black black metallic straps and chairs and the science\n"," stacked with four doors. he got in the doorway and\n"," dragged it across the road to the opposite door. then\n"," i walked back down a place in the window and\n"," put it back in the head. and saw the key\n"," come out. she rattled on the corridor and pulled up\n"," the staircase. he could see the door open like a\n"," sound in the air. \"is that the one?\" he asked.\n"," \"we need to kill your with a place of cases.\n"," you know what you are. i know what she was.\n"," you owe me a move in your hand and you\n"," keep the big guy alive in the mirror. and i’ll\n"," find the problem and do it right now. thank you\n"," for the army, believe you don't know. you were going\n"," to have to leave your own for the hotel. and\n"," it was a hundred pounds. all this case, i mean.\n"," they could have been in the system. maybe they were\n"," building a huge place. they were still keys at a\n"," flight of perfume. the door

been heading for the night like a\n"," certain animal involved. they had a ride to their eyes\n"," a mile away from friday. there are only five ways\n"," of outer cabinet. the driver shook his head. 'put the\n"," heater in front of me in the corner of the\n"," first building was a large bathroom that led to a\n"," long corridor. some of them had about three feet out\n"," of the driveway. it had a light in the air.\n"," he could see nothing. he saw a faint red pick-up\n"," passing and the cold lights around the stall was like\n"," a voice in his pocket. no windows. just a second\n"," group of people. a man who had been there. from\n"," a bus. it was a recent canvas towel. he stopped\n"," for a long time. the other. he snapped his arms\n"," in his pocket and folded his arms into his waist.\n"," loosened his arm into his nose. said he would leave\n"," it, and then he answered for a second for the\n"," correct one. but he looked at herself and asked, ‘why\n"," would these guys expect me to do he here?\" the\n"," guy said, said, ‘i won’t tell you where i mean?\"\n"," \"i'll go to the bank, i can see the two\n"," men where sloop is. you could be in the same\n"," day.\" \"you could call you on. but it's a reasonable\n"," wide view from the front. and they were sleeping for\n"," her coffee club. i had a ride to the precinct\n"," room and told me that half-inch factory. roscoe was sitting\n"," in a distant elevator and she was still leaking it\n"," up.\" she nodded. \"a staff for hours. i think i\n"," won’t come outside and go to the company in seth’s\n"," back lot. the girl came out of the place and\n"," smiled. it was about a mile across. a brief old\n"," pair of in the shadow of the highway. i could\n"," see the chevy pointing sideways at him for a moment.\n"," reacher heard the motel door move and the cars move\n"," off, and then it idled with me. the light line\n"," force fell inside and he slammed the car to a\n"," stop. then he put a knife to his head and\n"," listened hard. he waited. the foreman asked, “i guess they\n"," woke up. he’s going to be back in here. for\n"," a spell. i knew it was just a guy, and\n"," it was the same as thirty tons of green olive\n"," air from the curb ahead. she was looking at him\n"," like she was trying to recall the best case, and\n"," he got a decision. he was away from the woman\n"," which was another time before. the woman looked at me.\n"," the guy in the voice, black and still. he was\n"," holding a pair of paper. reacher sprawled at the engine\n"," glass and pushed back and slammed the door. looked at\n"," the back of the box beside her. she was wearing\n"," a blue coat and footsteps in the concrete feet in\n"," the distance, inside the sheriff’s department, and then five or\n"," four of them, and in the highway. cars were hanging\n"," back in the east, sitting there, pointing sideways at the\n"," register rather than awkward. \"don't take the guy out. but\n"," they need a flight of clothes. we need to get\n"," in the back of the car. i think he was\n"," driving and i had a spot of the bright glow\n"," that kept them in a yard of the duncan world\n"," reserved to let him make the body feel like a\n"," field four floors as he counted for the early attempt.\n"," all the way i had found to wait until i\n"," heard the engine in the darkness. \"ok, make me contact\n"," in a secret at least even as hell about it.\"\n"," \"you o.k.?\" \"i don't know.\" \"you ok?\" \"you won't drive\n"," yourself off. he’s just waiting for you to pay the\n"," threat from the start of the hoover store. they did,\n"," and i had to be out there on the outside\n"," of the store. the doctor was screaming. he was already\n"," about a few minutes later. but he had no attention.\n"," then he asked, ‘you going?’ ‘like a nice theory before.\"\n"," \"but he doesn’t want to watch us get out.\" \"you\n"," can come in,” i said. “did we join you on\n"," the other, another missing thing who says bobby was digging\n"," out on the porch. in a breath was like a\n"," short beam on the floor. two rooms. eight and a\n"," half inches of intelligence was there. the standard fence on\n"," the door was open like a cell truck. the air\n"," was a screaming box. reacher stepped inside. heard nothing. i\n"," was waiting at the door. the idling car was still\n"," in his face with a wad of ice and a\n"," room on the far side, and new clothes. the message\n"," on the same thing, the government air is very thick\n"," for its people in the system. it explains how much\n"," the lawyer called back on the place. you need to\n"," say something to get the phone to the keys and\n"," kill everything the first way.\" \"you're going to help me,\n"," soldier. it's the same guy they should know.” “we need\n"," to do that?

and the\n"," bus started, no real one on the last minute of\n"," the pictures they had been fighting with. i was a\n"," mile away. i sat down on the brake steps and\n"," started walking. then he had gotten straight in. no one\n"," hadn't check right back away in a house. he was\n"," also a lot longer than the same. the station gate\n"," had dropped on the garage and stopped. the engine turned\n"," and the sleeves looped around and bounced over the bus\n"," where it was both comfortable. it felt like a big\n"," guy in a white area waiting for a response. the\n"," first way was a tiny shot to go. he could\n"," see a hiss of dust with a battered cotton carpet.\n"," the metal siding fell from the windows and the highway\n"," roared and bouncing around the noise and stopped a little.\n"," he was talking to her father in the city. the\n"," doctor had to go to the hotel for stopping a\n"," little more. second, you can do it anyway. in the\n"," middle of the time they say she jumped out of\n"," the field. she was moving with her passport and her\n"," atm phone and her cell phone from the others, in\n"," the car, brushing his tears to the guy’s watch and\n"," eased it out of his pocket. it swung wide and\n"," rose away in the trees, and the electric crown vic\n"," cast through a pair of iron and a bullet of\n"," a faint angle from the street ahead. he saw the\n"," construction coming from to the range. but a man from\n"," the whole place was a friend of a mess. he\n"," had to be looking up at the body of the\n"," house, the same thing. or then bad things. he had\n"," gotten him up outside of life and had given him\n"," a decent sheet of guy on the side, in a\n"," tree. he said, ‘the pieces of the the third week\n"," are the army. and where i think. and i don’t\n"," believe much of it he was saying. then finlay was\n"," caught in the car, hunting the glock into the clip\n"," with the muzzle of his hand and carried it around\n"," the shotgun and i made up the key. i put\n"," it in my pocket and stood still for a moment\n"," and then opened the door. he watched the rough old\n"," man through the windshield and pulled the bag out of\n"," the chair. there was a television machine in the table.\n"," his cell phone rang and her baby daughter off one\n"," hand and looked away at her and nodded. she was\n"," a big guy, just a whole lot more than two\n"," times long, then then the dead man who had been\n"," ready to catch around from my bag. the old guy\n"," nodded and put the bolt back on the sidewalk and\n"," lifted up the head, and saw it disappear through the\n"," steps with a little silverware that was a problem on\n"," his mind. he knew who the afternoon train is on\n"," the floor himself. they were sleeping on such enormous places.\n"," then the lights were quiet. he opened the door. fired\n"," between the back of the wheel and the brake and\n"," the doors, and the moving cap was printed from them.\n"," there was a faint aluminum machine. the foreman didn’t go\n"," in. she said, ‘i don’t like a name for the\n"," u.s. id you want to assume the damn shape is\n"," like that. the whole thing is a smart guy. they’re\n"," not going to make a difference in line, ok?” “i\n"," need to talk if you were home there, actually. it's\n"," no kind of about where to where? in the bar\n"," i heard a loud camera fitted to the gas block\n"," and the lobby surface was clear of the old cardboard\n"," panel. the boy was completely taller than he could get\n"," around the lower station and kill him at least a\n"," long time. but most of them would be a hundred\n"," pounds. none of them was going to be visible here\n"," and down, rolled out of the loop from behind. a\n"," minute later we drove out in the gloom. it was\n"," a dark angle, and a thick yellow light exploded against\n"," the sand on the floor. the wheel drove past. it\n"," was the size of a random internal facility. a tiny\n"," motion of her face. she was made of ice sounds.\n"," she was busy in the darkness. the next man, reacher\n"," was sitting in the aisle before he saw he had\n"," been driving in in the same way. there was a\n"," garment bag in the centre of his head, breathing bent,\n"," with his neck drumming his body against the path of\n"," her jacket. froelich was screaming and she was tired. she\n"," had felt pretty good. she was doing the same thing.\n"," his shoulders were grey. he was not alone. the wipers\n"," were ready to make that thirty steps up to the\n"," floor level. i don't want a girl like that. i\n"," don't know for sure who didn't worry about, aren’t they\n"," sure?” i said, she had a black knife again, and\n"," her secretary was alone. it looked like she had to\n"," ask at all. he was in a sentry store in\n"," some kind of an invitation in the city. he watched\n"," her walk down to the second. it was a wad\n"," of fresh cap and a clipboard in the wrecked bottle.\n"," he stumbled in and jabbed to his knees. reacher put\n"," the hammer forward and stepped back to the table. a\n"," tiny guy home. the crowd was in the truck and\n"," his smile was wedged on his head. the driver saw\n"," him get out of the whole place. she had no\n"," in it. she had a smile. she was a question\n"," of mrs hobie's medical plates and a little houses in\n"," town. and they were no good. it was a few\n"," more in the metal club after a little more than\n"," a quarter of a hundred yards in the yard. i\n"," looked at the files with the muzzle and maneuvered it\n"," over the corner and put the phone back in the\n"," trunk and looped around the curb to get the money.\n"," it was a big guy right in front of him.\n"," he didn’t know what to do with the army. he\n"," had been near the car on the rocky glass. reacher\n"," saw himself there and steadied it up against the back\n"," of the block and leaned forward together and stretched. got\n"," a rag management and bring him off over the watch.\n"," and then do that . and all of this more\n"," or certainly. and he wanted to find his gate a\n"," long time ago, but he looked like a pair of\n"," dust you found to the start. the little train passed\n"," and switched out to be another place. the house drove\n"," back, and it stopped. then the street went still. 'i\n"," assume we’re very bad, you show up eventually. i wish\n"," you did. but i wouldn't have a good mistake. i\n"," wanted to hire the dead guy all over to his\n"," head, right?” “so who are the fault is the guy.\n"," the constitution was a small witness. that’s what he was\n"," looking for to worry about there before.” “you seem there.\n"," it was the right piece of messages in front of\n"," it. the state office was about over. the old guy\n"," came up to finlay. he was staring at me, behind\n"," the car. her lips were wide open and warm and\n"," smooth. he stepped out and dragged the trigger. he stopped\n"," again in the world, then walking, just at first moment\n"," he had dragged him back along a flight of water.\n"," it was a natural roll of dark metal pants and\n"," heavy lights cars and thick dark paint and windows and\n"," yellow hair. the road was a metal ford structure made\n"," on the far corner. the left-hand tires were visible. the\n"," overall train was the same as they had come, then\n"," the air was silent. the garage was deserted. nothing was\n"," going to be really going to look like a professional\n"," id. it worked pretty close. i saw a fire driver's\n"," seat. the door opened again. i recognized the blood back\n"," in the in the store and the sky was a\n"," loud old silence than a narrow square path of the\n"," stairs. up and out of the lounge wall behind the\n"," motel door. \"i'm going to need your life, make some\n"," other cup here. you have to do the pictures to\n"," from the house?’ ‘do you like you?” reacher nodded. “i\n"," mean, the friends called and the feeling was a minor\n"," problem on the fourth. the woman said, ‘what about you\n"," going to be.\" \"no, she's a very good night back\n"," from the loan lists on and ended up. the street\n"," was empty. no guards. no evidence could be there, except\n"," just the grange steel windows. i leaned up on the\n"," floor. villanueva pushed it alongside me. i was still still\n"," in the corner of the hotel car. the last few\n"," names were better. the other train was full of night-time\n"," steel. the door opened and the car came into a\n"," desk with a solid dark broken box on the roof.\n"," the kliner man reached his mind and then carried the\n"," key into his pocket. the key was still where he\n"," remembered the house. it was three thousand yards from the\n"," space would be abandoned. the rear door was misted with\n"," damp snow and the dust was closed. it had a\n"," space ahead. there were clouds full of space in the\n"," darkness, but it had been a car with a prison\n"," car a hundred yards towards the road. he turned to\n"," her and waited. hit the same picture he would move\n"," out of the ceiling. the wind. holly stood up and\n"," breathed back and checked it and put his hands back\n"," in his eyes. stared at the bathroom wall again. he\n"," was gone. he had borrowed coffee. the driver stepped aside\n"," as she waited a beat and listened to the lawyer\n"," propped against the sofa and spun away. froelich walked through\n"," the snow and swung out of the foyer and east.\n"," there were seven random numbers visible in the dark air\n"," of light. half of them were the noise was still\n"," on the right. like a fake interior hole. he made\n"," it to the middle of the vehicle avenue, and got\n"," away and led a hundred yards ahead and pushed it\n"," through the rear door and found his last target. he\n"," said, ‘i can kill me, too. we don’t know what\n"," they are, and he'll have to call the same kind\n"," of status say you may have to be seeing the\n"," progress. that's why you can place him to work,\" i\n"," said. reacher shook his head. \"all the only case, isn't\n"," the same thing, isn’t she?\" reacher said, \"i don't know.’\n"," she said, ‘i mean, about it,\" i said. \"and thanks\n"," if you do it. ask for the question?\" he shrugged.\n"," stared at the windshield. \"i know who they need to\n"," do?” she whispered. “you o.k.?\" reacher asked. \"what do you\n"," want to do?” “and you know what happens to you,\n"," i'll come to me like you won’t be a problem.\"\n"," \"but don’t worry about what we really thought i was.\n"," i’m getting to you,” i said. “why didn’t you?\" \"there\n"," was a real kid. why were you wrong about the\n"," real problem at the place. but they just said, “the\n"," office wasn’t a year. he was his country records. it\n"," was a guy who was woken somewhere in my experience\n"," held a split-second problem. instead, he didn’t answer. he said,\n"," ‘we’re an investigator. we’ll get to me, you're a waste\n"," of reasons. there's nothing to do with the money worth\n"," a tight cup of dust and paint. they and shirt\n"," on the ceiling. a special guy, the

can't be shot there?” “that was the\n"," first sort of thing she didn't see?” “no,” i said.\n"," i turned my head down and swiveled my mind off\n"," my glass. the woman's eyes were open. i was clamped\n"," up on the table, but i was a mile away.\n"," i could smell the dark under the electric springs from\n"," the door and into the gloom and found the motel\n"," room for a long, long moment. then they stood still\n"," for a second and then picked up the box and\n"," held it out. i was wearing a dark desk and\n"," a steel bell. the tires were on his lips. it\n"," was warm and tight and wide and dusty. the roof\n"," was like a badge of unfinished information. another tired room,\n"," pointing over him and secure. the most place was certainly\n"," sitting in a crowd of phone streets in the other\n"," direction. time to sit down and get a name. when\n"," can you write the mail to the key. you've got\n"," to know who he is,\" he said. he said, ‘or\n"," was it a decent risk. the briefcase came with me\n"," and the colonel nodded to the beginning, in his voice,\n"," in the act of photographs. but that was as close\n"," as the new truck. a man who had to have\n"," held her in the house. i was in their service\n"," cars. the door was a light metal truck, which made\n"," a big light and their flights burned and it was\n"," completely showing a couple of days and they were not\n"," short of course. they were holding the first crew as\n"," soon as he could. pauling didn't blame him again, because\n"," he was going to be on that particular road. he\n"," wondered how we would be in the whole street. i\n"," was waiting for them. i was gone. i was always\n"," all the way right at the top of the main\n"," station house at the end of the door with a\n"," little two wire unit hard on the main seat, as\n"," they forgot that the two guys climbed back in through\n"," the door and saw him and rubbed the flashlight for\n"," her. \"so how much about this?’ ‘there’s a chain in\n"," the middle of montana in a lot of person he\n"," thought about it.’ sorenson said, ‘you got a very damn\n"," capable guy. he sounded like he was in the middle\n"," of the reception counter and had taken a look at\n"," the marriott and a problem. two hundred dollars in the\n"," third place. so does the thing arrest her, at that\n"," way, when they can break the room and make sure\n"," we

was a potential police department. i got back in the\n"," car. the door opened and a cell phone rang. the\n"," round door was full of an innocent place filled with\n"," stars and pink. it was tired and flat and smelled\n"," of the people on the left. the engine was dark\n"," and the wheels were bouncing on the bottom on the\n"," side of his ear. a long circle on the floor.\n"," the leader wrapped the bill around his chest and picked\n"," it up and he stood at the table. the wind\n"," was still up. the horizon was smooth and clean. no\n"," other sign i was saying. i wasn’t sure what

big clerk who\n"," walked through friday. the hoover station was humped and gone\n"," as they pinned on and washed upright in a mahogany\n"," stool and rusted tiny arms. so she couldn’t salter’s

good person. so,\n"," or either day in the place. not good. he was\n"," in a hundred yards in the air, with a sight\n"," of its mother's hose standing against the left, and the\n"," door was a big place. reacher was barefoot and green\n"," and slow, and pretty, like a bed on a square\n"," nine and a solid alarm of dim all the way\n"," in front of the next vehicle of the edge he\n"," could see the sound of a grey earth ahead of\n"," me in the air bolted to the shoulder to pay\n"," her minutes. the gun fell down and smiled and jammed\n"," to a stop there in the dirt opposite the

of\n"," about a mile from the daylight that was already done\n"," in the united states. the general's family was good. it\n"," was pretty good, but it was a little faster than\n"," nineteen miles away and by the sort of car a\n"," guy came out of a building for a moment and\n"," opened it up. i waited. it was a lifetime old.\n"," she said, ‘we need to eat the infantry tonight. and\n"," then get you

to use their final\n"," response in the past. he bent hard and whipped his\n"," head into the next hut. they were a pair of\n"," bone blue and winter shirts and old dirty cap and\n"," they could see a different field. the last two seconds.\n"," the bright glow in the wind. the floor was covered\n"," in a roof. reacher could see a large concrete rectangle\n"," on the window made of chairs locked a complete circle\n"," and stopped walking. the air was damp and empty. their\n"," legs were resting on their pants pocket, and the sleeves\n"," cut around and he was wearing a short plastic sight\n"," of his neck. he had a short package of paper\n"," on them. it was a quiet corporal with a new\n"," man's shot in his hand. she was claiming to leave\n"," it until she was lost to sight where she was\n"," saying. she just nodded again. \"how was the duncans like\n"," that?’ ‘i can go on?” “it was a big guy.\n"," that’s the boss is the first thing, they both do\n"," it. but we’re not sure you won’t need to shoot\n"," the money from the first part of the way and\n"," he swore information. she was worried. she did him and\n"," the heat from the cover of the side ran back\n"," to the mouth of the house. they were dressed in\n"," a row of cold chairs burning over plastic. the agents\n"," were still there, less than fifty, with wood stains on\n"," the and white road boxed in and made reacher look\n"," very tired. two in the evening, a word. it was\n"," a big boy. each vehicle was still in the front\n"," of the road in the shadows. it was a wise\n"," room. reacher breathed out and unlatched the maps on his\n"," hands and his hair. he heard the door open and\n"," relax. he heard the low lazy sedan ring and stopped.\n"," it was a little cold, but they were seen with\n"," two of them taking a large message. and it was\n"," like a million times. the woman with his cell phone\n"," said, ‘it was a word. which is just the same\n"," way as possible, right? she was a good friend of\n"," the new sense than i had to get. i heard\n"," the tires running in the windshield to the horizon. he\n"," stripped off his two headlights and knocked himself back to\n"," the table, and then

wad of single patches in the\n"," whole trip. he took a breath, and waited. then he\n"," scooped up his sole and hauled it up under his\n"," chest. passed it outside and fired them up. the lock\n"," door creaked and stopped. he put the blade back like\n"," a thin piece of money. reacher could feel it straight\n"," in the taurus and arrive and stay there in the\n"," middle of the eight other. the guy with the chair\n"," was a pick-up office and the driver was gone. he\n"," was tempted to piece her report. she was in the\n"," office line. she was already standing there in the hallway\n"," outside the woods. he was facing out, out of the\n"," gap ahead, tired, fast, short in the gloom. the younger\n"," clock inside the other desk was looking for coffee in\n"," his head work. he said, ‘not going to be a\n"," little, and i want to haul you in. then you\n"," say it.\" \"it was an fbi unit in margrave. a\n"," person and a car and a whole different guy would\n"," be there coming out. so i were waiting for the\n"," fact i was a word, but he was on his\n"," way out. then he heard a picture of the exact\n"," same thing on the north. but it wasn't nearly cold.\n"," he drove the other way and hauled it backward against\n"," the driveway. the abandoned truck eased in. reacher could hear\n"," them. the door went wide. there was a security building.\n"," it was a window behind a small line, facing south\n"," and south, lost a small concrete stair carrier parked on\n"," the track painted stone running with the soft rest and\n"," the red wheels roaring. the shotgun pulled through the low\n"," earth and stopped. the tires did the same thing three\n"," hundred miles away from the computer. he heard a candy\n"," hall and a mug of white keys in a rolling\n"," machine. i took up the bags and went back to\n"," the call room and killed the stink of motor beams,\n"," and they peeled off the headlight beams and stopped dead.\n"," still untouched. he was facing side by side at the\n"," table, and then his body was moving slow. the young\n"," house was still on the wheel looking at the wheel,\n"," like a problem. two hundred yards south was a very\n"," long blow to a stop. they tracked the shower so\n"," that they looked tired and crumpled and he got a\n"," full message. just staring at her. i was in a\n"," nice hotel in the house for four minutes. the woman\n"," rang, and reacher was aware of her with his jaw.\n"," his hand was rigid on his chest. a black metallic\n"," wood which used him to understand of my jaw. no\n"," sound at all, but they had just called her. he\n"," was smiling. i paused a beat and said, “where was\n"," what you don't think?\" \"well, they can't believe what i\n"," do about there?” “just they get in after us.’ then\n"," she said, ‘we’ve got a gun in a problem, you\n"," can do anything at all. tell me i'm a little\n"," bad, too. you've got to let us take the briefcase.\"\n"," \"a new folk to do later.” “i was there, i'm\n"," not sure about it.\" reacher shook his head. \"so go\n"," on the office for two months. but you need to\n"," call you and buy a sign with a guy just\n"," to make out it.\" she nodded back. \"i need to\n"," do it,” reacher said. “i have a mistake. so you're\n"," not in itself. but if you feel about me. then\n"," i can tell. i have a question of course. i\n"," have to know what you need. therefore my brother. we\n"," can know what we want, right?\" \"for there?\" \"then i'm\n"," assuming you knew where it is. i’m going to find\n"," the phone with the name. we won't see me like\n"," he needs to avoid it. and i’m not a good\n"," outcome in the city, if i want to figure out\n"," who you know to have to ask you to meet\n"," me here,\" she said. \"i'm the same thing as a\n"," financial security clerk. if you said he wouldn't have to\n"," come away.\" reacher nodded. \"if he did leave the talking.\n"," told him not to drop a word then, and check\n"," it off on the head, did they decide to go.\"\n"," the guard took out a phone and took off and\n"," pushed away. they were on the left wall, knocking and\n"," pointing again and kicking her own report. she was in\n"," a big bedroom step down to the motel, and then\n"," a huge chevy machine ticked around. then * duncan made\n"," it look like a slow case, which meant the overseas\n"," was going to be going on in a hundred per\n"," cent of the job is in the future. a couple\n"," of old women are helping me down here for a\n"," week for something.\" \"you won't tell you if he’s running\n"," around, and we’ll get the stock back in the way\n"," you do.’ the guy looked at him. his heart was\n"," smaller enough to pull the desert items down from the\n"," sidewalks. so it was a big. the woman just turned\n"," his head again and looked out the window. he was\n"," looking at his computer room. it was a new guy.\n"," three flights of paper ties and the way it was\n"," the worst girl to do was a matter of money,\n"," or a hostage friend with a decent trail. like a\n"," standard sniper bus and an earlier girl. the house, the\n"," boy was worried about it. no sign of the last.\n"," no danger of seeing money in the office screen. she\n"," put her head back in the cold light. she said,\n"," ‘i don't know. and i doubt first. like that would\n"," be the one on the end. if he got the\n"," phone that couldn't add on the new hotel for a\n"," week. but it was a lonely man. and he didn’t\n"," know why the even guy’s kids had put up even\n"," before. either night or seventy days would be after that.\n"," not yet, but maybe a hundred and fifty miles away\n"," after midnight, which is the middle of the time .\n"," he asked, ‘why not?\" \"we're very pleased to come and\n"," tear the desk look around on the darkness and get\n"," his arm, too. it was a single crowd of energy\n"," and he was breathing in a pile of dust. he\n"," walked back down to the table and stepped out to\n"," the abandoned corner of the apartment and got up and\n"," opened the door. he took the alarm blade off the\n"," table and leaned level with the blind a second. then\n"," she set off trying to stay out of the diner.\n"," then i was looking for the station. certainly i could\n"," hear the wind. i could see nothing in his head.\n"," just a blur of a sandwich of dust. the other\n"," guy moved the scratch of his eye out of his\n"," passport and pushed his neck and held them with his\n"," throat and turned his head up to look at the\n"," wrench at him. \"there's a hole in a tree. as\n"," soon as i get up of the lounge and drive\n"," on, both of them in the back. on the front\n"," end of the house, a different road, and then he\n"," kicked a yard through the barn. the ceiling was still\n"," blue. i could smell a smell of headlights in the\n"," trees, looking at one of the ways of the system\n"," in her own life. but she was a genuine man,\n"," maybe not right there. she was a new problem for\n"," him. then he knew exactly what he was doing. he\n"," sat down in the side and kept his hands in\n"," his pocket and saw a guy watching the head, standing\n"," in the side of his face. he stared ahead and\n"," folded the coffee. stared at him and said, ‘ok, like\n"," i asked if i had used them. i didn’t want\n"," to make the job. i was saying. i said, “you\n"," don't need to know if you were the nature of\n"," an interesting time to lose. we had no tactical luck\n"," and rank and diesel at it. it was always a\n"," boy. the woman was in the living room, listening to\n"," an inch. no guys in the head. just a big\n"," old diesel shack in front of me. it was a\n"," thin guy like winding plastic like a faint angry major\n"," card mail the same way he had been looking for\n"," music, and the radio had been cared if he had\n"," been able to send the key back from space to\n"," the centre of the windows in the dark and hard\n"," wood on the platform reacher heard a door and a\n"," brown box soaked to the door. he walked over and\n"," headed for the house. reacher took the picture out of\n"," his jacket and waited. he could hear a whisper of\n"," paper inside the chamber of the crowd. there was no\n"," question to build to the outer road, because he could\n"," get his eyes a fraction into the world. he could\n"," watch the ground, a savage yellow rain mounted on the\n"," roof of their thirties, and threaded up the slow space\n"," over the black light. they walked a fraction with a\n"," third back in the city. it was a little tired\n"," in the same room than i had ever seen before.\n"," then he got out of the car and ran his\n"," way around the car. he stood down and hauled him\n"," right into the hallway. the crowd stepped back to the\n"," bathroom and the noise was still in it. broadway was\n"," warm and wide, but the rush he could tell the\n"," cop he had thrown up the humvee and realized he\n"," had told him he would have to be a total\n"," of private records eight days old. but i was watching\n"," the new police department. i knew there was nothing out\n"," there at all. i stopped and put it back in\n"," my pocket and held it up. she nodded, his battered\n"," eyes closed. \"i have a big security guy. she was\n"," pretty sure she was in the room in the hills.\n"," she had pushed me up into a long picture. the\n"," shotgun was standing down at the sidewalk. alice was still\n"," staring at me. the guy rode still and waited. he\n"," glanced left. he took a long downward look at reacher’s\n"," long and dressed. he saw no lights from the lobby\n"," beyond. the end of the first road was a few\n"," o'clock from a cab in a completely big length of\n"," sight. the lobby was silent. they were stacked on two\n"," steps above the gap and their headlights spilled up on\n"," the woman and then stepped away and sat down in\n"," the room, over her salter bar. she was facing the\n"," same way, not tired, and half fast with a pair\n"," of stale footprints. he put the gun back on his\n"," side and held his head out from behind her desk.\n"," she was ready to stay out and tell him to\n"," do it. because if i actually especially did. i was\n"," hearing he was the right thing to do in the\n","

you, ok? i let it slide off. and then it\n"," was the same thing, the guy on the left was\n"," still up with the sentries in the mouth of the\n"," rosewood car. i was never going to move all the\n"," way up in the department point before he had said,\n","\n","\n","Writing to file...Done!\n","=====================================================\n","====Generating text====\n","Diversity:

pauling didn’t look pretty bad at\n"," the direction we wanted the people to deal there, and\n"," there was no more going to read his cell phone,\n"," and so it was an outside will center of a\n"," handle. he saw nothing. reacher walked closer for a twenty\n"," yards and we saw the rooming house. reacher drove on\n"," level with bird. the building kept low. there were music\n"," blowing under the plaza and the air stayed wide and\n"," smoke and the tires were on the sofa. the trees\n"," were still still and still under the new air, all\n"," over the slight picture, spinning the windshield as far as\n"," he could. he could see their tired oil ruts thirty\n"," feet shorter than i had come, so he heard the\n"," cold. he steadied the ladder against the door, one big\n"," man as well, a big low item and a short\n"," glance at a run. slow tray. he got a beat.\n"," tried and said: and everyone will be smelling of it\n"," here, which means these are armstrong long anymore. they keep\n"," the bus flat on the front. we let them lift\n"," the taurus up. do you control me with him,\" he\n"," said. \"ok,\" reacher said. \"i want you to check your\n"," watch for the nature of the time. and that’s the\n"," route with the motor designed to check his names told\n"," him the words from them he would stand in a\n"," tidy entrance north and east. we talked about the breakfast\n"," hut. i crept back into the lounge, set out ten\n"," miles west of the fence above the gate. the bright\n"," flames showed it twice an inch between their heels and\n"," one of it with a man’s breasts. then he looked\n"," at their food and moved by the staircase and sipped\n"," the bus on the driveway. found his house. “see you\n"," down here?” he said. “but you know this case, they're\n"," looking to start your own, reacher. if you’re in an\n"," excellent position. then the army helps the effect. it was\n"," a split second taller than a sign chase. the fifth\n"," security is the same as it is. which is just\n"," nine hours, if they know, and because of the computer\n"," was nearly old and he was a smart guy for\n"," human nature. he was seeing the smart visit directly near\n"," my commercial news. the tiny force, half four miles. one\n"," minute later he walked around to the front. hubble had\n"," been past more likely of it. the cars had been\n"," dressed. both guys would not take it from. there were\n"," no reaction at all. he was smiling. it was a\n"," small staff room, past right in the cold and south.\n"," reacher climbed inside the ground and opened the door and\n"," put the wheel on the guy’s eye and checked the\n"," bony gun, facing south. the cadillac fell off and the\n"," inner doors died open. 'i hope he elected to hold\n"," it over.’ ‘i don’t believe this?\" reacher nodded. \"we called\n"," my job as a legitimate idea about the car before.\"\n"," walker said nothing. \"you can't be ok?’ the guy said,\n"," “is he going to want you to help you as\n"," bad as you can do. i've got to call your\n"," energy first.’ ‘i saw those secret with anything worth from\n"," them.\" \"you guys think you don't feel good. but you've\n"," got no names. you know, shall you say?” “why would\n"," you talk to?” she nodded. “but he’s our fault, right?\"\n"," she said. they're just a code and trouble in the\n"," middle of the owner. that was all in total. bought\n"," an ugly smell of paper. the door was cold and\n"," cold and had a small and sound with a plate\n"," towel. just a cop table, ten top men in new\n"," jeans and a black shirt. the table was filling cold\n"," white cardboard and sweat and black bottles and good eyes,\n"," maybe half the same way. i got a question. and\n"," went to walk to the vehicle and the glow of\n"," a mental horizon. the tent hit the trees and the\n"," rear door. reacher saw the same kind of command of\n"," death. for on the ground to happen to join it\n"," might be involved. i got the glance up at the\n"," horizon as far as jackson was saying. i waited. people\n"," were wired to halfway through the sun in the warm\n"," space of the pile gate faced a wide smile. the\n"," tan. she didn’t reply to that. she glanced around, and\n"," closed her eyes a little. started and concentrated on a\n"," khaki pressure attached to the focus was an open blade\n"," at a thin car, running straight straight straight ahead, aiming\n"," and killed reacher, like a young version of her money\n"," in about three hours, or not. not because of the\n"," boxes reacher might be called with her instead. he didn’t.\n"," “he’s in that bright office saturday cash is designed to\n"," conceal the story, present. nobody helps the secret card when\n"," we go on on, we tell me that?’ ‘why?’ ‘i\n"," was on the main end of the hut. and i\n"," wanted plenty of attention to holly. i told me hard\n"," to show a file right next to the army sergeant.\n"," so we said that for sure. so i was all\n"," alone in here too. it just looked like a soft\n"," deal who isn’t dead.\" the guy smiled. \"not denying where\n"," it was,\" he said. \"they didn't never be a tough\n"," thing with a fairly certain gesture. she said nothing. 'so\n"," what are you doing or there?” “she can explain where\n"," nothing was yet. then the syrian called her even after\n"," another. she was smiling at a flash of dust in\n"," the deserted glass. across the platform the big house was\n"," a new man. plenty of other states had happened. it\n"," was the same as a pack armour punched in his\n"," shoulders. he was in the night two pounds. he could\n"," hear her perfume in his eyes. her lips were cold\n"," and quiet and slightly slow. the sheet felt like the\n"," crowd seemed to win. i felt like she'd lost the\n"," trail of his position, but it looked like a metal\n"," sweep walls and heavy electric boards, about six feet apart\n"," to keep me well up. and they want to help\n"," mrs king. maybe they found me every step of the\n"," type of place they would have happened to be. he\n"," could have been seeing money and two days later. an\n"," excellent kid. i want to start right in the car?’\n"," ‘i told you it was a guy to show

lobby, one of the natural\n"," tough states in the immense store. i calculated pair of\n"," blood people showed out in the air. he struggled inward\n"," for a moment and wrenched it head inward and waited\n"," until he waited. it was a gray hum and the\n"," tyre lights filled it. reacher could feel nothing. no windows\n"," in his ear. she could see the passage of intelligence\n"," and death. she was squatted in the field, gasping and\n"," comfortable. she opened her eyes and let his head go\n"," into roscoe’s living room, and then he left. charlie was\n"," wearing a black ford shirt, and his hand was full\n"," of heavy paper. then he closed the window again. the\n"," shower was still parked on the right. he saw the\n"," full was still but abandoned on foot. just a solid\n"," wall of old trees, and it was full of chairs\n"," and metal and silent air. the wind was still high\n"," in the middle of the light entrance and bounced up\n"," the next material. the driver was a long, long time\n"," ago. he was on paper in a spot while sorenson\n"," stayed in through the gate for a walk. he hit\n"," him there on the shoulder and saw him step up\n"," to the diner. he stayed on the counter. his breathing\n"," was warm under her head and he was staring at\n"," the clock in her head and reacher listened to how\n"," was alan barr. the bright motion of the kid was\n"," better than a little expensive. the paper was still in\n"," a cheap light, and they were small, and even hard.\n"," he saw the gun, not just the colour of a\n"," fixed turn on the right side of the long corner\n"," of the column. there was a chair on the side\n"," of the car. he knew that were sure.” “they would\n"," want to go out of the car and run fast.\n"," what the hell she wanted. \"i'm not thinking about. i\n"," know where they are. i need to tell you what\n"," time you do.\" \"that's for damn sure. this is a\n"," training saturday is in the downstairs section. which means i\n"," don't see a ride in

place on the end of any other location\n"," of a year. she told me one thing, but not\n"," turning and pulled up for the little flight of space.\n"," then they found the train within fifteen miles an hour\n"," and fired his low papers from the noise and stopped\n"," where i needed to need. the screen was too warm.\n"," he could see the fourth perimeter, and the guy was\n"," wearing a cotton blue shirt and a white denim shirt,\n"," and a new piece of new white physical eyes, one\n"," cops in the last and day from la in the\n"," east, at the air. new news. she paused for a\n"," second. then he put the gun back in his pocket.\n"," he sent my breath. the four men in the dark.\n"," every four paces. he found the hood. the guy from\n"," his head was going to make it look like a\n"," big phone. so you were in the shower and the\n"," dragon army we had ever used to start worth a\n"," firm bullet because his sergeant had been wearing being planted\n"," in the wind. a squad room. the rear bar force\n"," and alone was a thin target. it looked completely slow\n"," and straight, there was a bright reception area in the\n"," lobby. there was a stone car named in the center\n"," of her office and given him a key at his\n"," face. he felt the last to walk back to the\n"," dark room you wrote to you. you can get up\n"," after that thing.\" \"no idea,” neagley said. ‘there’s nothing like\n"," that. they leave the strip at a car. they want\n"," him out below those secret records the old victim nor\n"," apart from the travel house, and i was a special\n"," box, and if i was moving. i wanted to. i\n"," didn’t explain anything.’ ‘what, like a phone station in the\n"," morning or the station house of eight hours he had\n"," seen a standard valley or still a hour later. this\n"," guy was in paris all alone. it was a hell\n"," of a house, very hot. so it was all turned\n"," on and a whole time, then the sandy guy stepped\n"," forward and moved in and took out her motor glasses\n"," as soon as he saw the lock and walked through\n"," to the back end of the plaza. then he cruised\n"," east and open the trapdoor and walked through the gate.\n"," the driver was asleep. reacher’s breathing was loud and then\n"," he came back down until the sky was blinding under\n"," a red brick door, beyond a soft china cell. the\n"," truck was cold and empty. the sky was painted vivid\n"," and noisy and the lights were of small green, but\n"," the windshield was clear to a short tube and a\n"," tiny suv on the right. the crunch of a short\n"," button. reacher walked around the rear of the gate. he\n"," got in a chair. it was a dark coffee case.\n"," it was very suspicious that i would have been seeing\n"," his friends when swan got lucky. he went to get\n"," ready to see the chances of the bureau since with\n"," a big view of the secret in a room, showing\n"," the california hole on the ground. not just a marine\n"," system in that way.” “you remember all it is. so\n"," you're not saying. there’s nothing as you should slam up.\"\n"," \"where are they saying to me about it,\" summer said.\n"," \"the truth is he didn’t want to tell me, when\n"," the duncans are

not\n"," about from a desk before he had fallen too hard,\n"," and started worrying about it. the hallway was a thick\n"," chrome hole with the blood set on them. plenty of\n"," construction always would have much more than use. there was\n"," a pair of silent wood in the air. he picked\n"," it up and folded it into the aisle and put\n"," it on the platform on duke’s door. \"i'm sure i\n"," want a lot of time when i remember the from?\"\n"," \"and the panic means you'd be in that.” “why would\n"," he have got past you,” she said. she waved the\n"," lower lock over again. webster slid off the keys and\n"," made him wait. he held it up.’ “i was going\n"," to be in the house in the military every respect.\n"," maybe in california, and they didn't waste it afterward. a\n"," million times only the fifth split lot was going to\n"," have to be a vague target. so we could go\n"," from. but now he was always always playing and almost\n"," he guessed, staying on the wrong left. i spent a\n"," mile to the south coast, long enough to be. i\n"," saw it. why would he make out what. i found\n"," a narrow tire face, five guys outside and almost lying\n"," in two heavy metal government dollars in the window somewhere,\n"," and we know, that’s the same thing that it is,\n"," now. and then you use your cell and told the\n"," truth and a roll of books was still inside a\n"," lot of eight hours. he turned a stool to me.\n"," tied it up. marilyn was thinking about the shoot phone\n"," number they saw money and got seriously hurt the front\n"," window for a thousand miles through the elevator. reacher saw\n"," her go behind. \"what does the idea say you want\n"," to go.\" he looked straight into the car at the\n"," map. bobby was still behind him. two wooden square blue\n"," suit built out through the green glass and a brief\n"," cross entrance into the far horizon. a square counterclockwise square\n"," ticket. a knock at the door. \"so what are you\n"," going to do?\" he turned his head and looked at\n"," himself out of the bedroom chair and looked back at\n"," her and looked at him. reacher looked across at me,\n"," with her briefcase at her desk. too close. \"you're here\n"," to ask you two responsibility for you?” reacher asked. she\n"," smiled. “no,” he said. “i planned to find and then\n"," stay down until reacher, then that’s exactly how the best\n"," part of the kid. so maybe we do lane late.\n"," the fifth means you got real sorry,\" he said. \"the\n"," girl was still right in the last floor. a couple\n"," of people just headed for the garage. but they went\n"," up to do anything yet. the bus peaked and he\n"," turned around and stood still and kept on looking at\n"," him. reacher waited a beat more, and then he dialled\n"," his brother himself. on station he was a detective in\n"," her time. she was wearing a sheaf of coffee. she\n"," had a silver hammer showing in her voice, close to\n"," the collar of his ear. she saw her come with\n"," him twenty feet ahead. \"i think you turn in and\n"," arrest me?’ peterson said, ‘why not?\" first thing and not.\n"," just the shower was standing behind him, beginning to sleep.\n"," he hadn’t hit the point of the keys, and he\n"," had changed as the rain could take. which was probably\n"," a light, all of the only place. vietnam in the\n"," same mp flight there they were spending it at the\n"," same time by there and a lot more impressed by\n"," the guys they got shot. you were unarmed. they got\n"," anywhere. in a third place i put the tape in\n"," my pocket. i walked around to the door and drove\n"," the whole length of the house. the door hit it\n"," and the ground stood still for a long minute. the\n"," room was almost already better. froelich turned and looked at\n"," the hospital in the bag and looked at the crime\n"," camera on the outer door, and i opened my eyes\n"," and came out. i walked back again, low to the\n"," desk, jammed and suddenly propped on the wheel. carmen hauled\n"," forward into his arm, hard and smooth. he came back\n"," with a muscle and started moving. the transmission grew off\n"," and he threw him on the table right at him.\n"," vladimir glanced at her and looked at her head behind\n"," her, then the old guy named her, watching me. the\n"," bus force wasn’t in particular. \"we have the choice of\n"," some one in a training card. and we heard some\n"," previous sense to the military. they were the next night,\n"," so suppose they were coming and waiting for them to\n"," press up into a shelf under his leg. then he\n"," turned and slid past the shelter and followed the two\n"," o'clock pick-up coming upstairs in the center of broadway on\n"," a rural station house. but they were made too many\n"," things. they were her paper. the giant crew got on.\n"," theoretically he was worried about a handsome place, all over\n"," his chest. to make sure she was in duty. no\n"," result. the smell of footprints. it looked like simultaneously occasional\n"," more way and thirty miles of me, five miles. seven\n"," and the army. two bullets in the office. the military\n"," pd showed up looking enough. i was certain it would\n"," be a cop that would get taken to take it\n"," a hundred years ago. certainly he’s going to die, because\n"," we've got a free guy in an kid if they’re\n"," guessing somewhere between a major visit for the office. i\n"," wanted to stay under virginia and give her a break\n"," and i shoot you. maybe we're not not a clear\n"," call down in the same front corner. so he took\n"," a perfect drink. he used the gate and came up\n"," again. the car had about fourteen feet. the truck was\n"," a lot faster than a big rectangle coming back at\n"," a long angle from the right-hand path deep over the\n"," wreckage of the brick near the tank. making the strap\n"," out of his shoulder. he drove away, with the bulk\n"," of the world. he came back in and met the\n"," neighbourhood ticking down the outside office chamber. reacher sat together\n"," in the seat next to the window and came back\n"," with the other end of the kitchen. the door stayed\n"," smashed. \"hey, you see? he was a big man, and\n"," he wasn't going to search it from where he was.\n"," and it was a heart building, not good. finally no\n"," way. i slipped my hands out of my collar and\n"," stepped out. nothing else. i thought about the words before,\n"," over the gas, but not inside the west. i could\n"," feel the front tires reading him, watching him. i was\n"," a pretty good song but she had been a mess.\n"," he had to let her get in with his own\n"," momentum and her throat was drawn out and shiny. she\n"," was ready to be there. he said, ‘you know why\n"," you worried you with that, right? if you fired the\n"," girl in the basement. and she checks the slip of\n"," around the centre of the table. at the end of\n"," my partner he could see blake sitting behind her desk\n"," and the phone in his hand. the sandy guard followed\n"," him to the back of the house. then he touched\n"," the floor, aiming for his gaze and saw the footsteps\n"," out, and followed the ground up to the map. it\n"," was more than a time, too. maybe no sound there.\n"," the guy said, ‘ok, sure joe deserves that will be\n"," a word. because you hear your “i tried to tell\n"," her?\" she shrugged. silence. \"this is for sure. it was\n"," a black measure he died, and he was listening to\n"," the middle on the street. he stopped next to his\n"," hair and snapped his coat to her neck, staring straight\n"," at him. she stood on the inside by the taurus\n"," and dropped her arm right on his waist. he gazed\n"," at the number she only trusted some use to make\n"," a call against his reaction and they stayed in aluminum\n"," with the biggest thing, and they’re coming. it was her\n"," new best stuff. because he was a real long time\n"," and he knew that part is in the army, right?\n"," the hell is your free son for somebody who needs\n"," a big thing. no idea what you asked, ‘there’s nothing\n"," to you?\" \"but let’s go,” i said. the guy went\n"," quiet again. reacher looped her finger around her head and\n"," checked it only in front of me at the gun\n"," itself. it was a voice and gregory was smiling. the\n"," trooper called the cell phone and stood quietly like he\n"," knew he was asking for them. “so our life. armstrong\n"," figures we’ll fake there on the promised road, to ever\n"," go. janet salter said, ‘the army wanted coffee?” i thought\n"," what happened. i wanted to use it on his ears\n"," and sit down and give it the biggest time. and\n"," then: back of the truck, i guessed he was probably\n"," easy enough to be glancing out at the distance together.\n"," he heard the road of the corner metal caught and\n"," then the lights came out of the gate. there was\n"," a big wave on the ground heading down to the\n"," door called garber against one of the streets and watched\n"," the parked plate for a moment, a foot nearer the\n"," front. she tried to see me and the bartender in\n"," the bathroom. i guess they were watching them on the\n"," bathroom. a cell phone showed smaller than the same shoe\n"," as exactly the same colour as a wide granite radius\n"," of the nearer lobby, the shaft of the clock waiting\n"," for each other as we fell down. i never saw\n"," his gun in the centre of the car.\" \"ok,\" she\n"," said. \"that's a tiny man, not there under the time.\n"," it could have been a straight hundred on the north\n"," in the shadows. nothing to see except those answering

suddenly tall, maybe fifty, because her, and delfuenso wouldn't\n"," do what it hadn’t been worth to me. which means\n"," that that joe was a good piece of paperwork and\n"," shit used to be if she entered one in a\n"," night, and then she put it in a complete black\n"," bar full of halo and fallen down and was wrong.\n"," i knew the guard might give him a kind of\n"," sound, or slow and slow, and i was behind the\n"," last time, so i could hear you at the ground\n"," from the table. i said, “what was he going to\n"," do?” “i don’t think i saw it? but we know\n"," where do you have to?” the doctor said, ‘that’s a\n"," completely common time.\" \"you're really going to be taken here.\"\n"," \"i was saying that?\" \"the file was not a winter\n"," i’d be going. i was pulling it away from the\n"," chair. i said, “when do you need your husband to\n"," know why you’ve done any of it.\" \"what can you\n"," do?’ “how long did you go?’ ‘i went straight to\n"," the desk for radio from kelham. they looked to the\n"," end. forty yards from west, it was full of heavy\n"," wooden chairs on a small opposite rock with a clear\n"," cabinet bolted and a swirling towel ahead, with a rubber\n"," leather glasses near his face. the reception room was still\n"," flat and smelled of oil and legs and black bills\n"," and the high gun, and then he strode back, talking.\n"," mcgrath bounced on the rock and bounced off the front,\n"," towards the lounge area and clicked the file off and\n"," knocked it out of the phone and collected the bag\n"," with a grocery on the night. the percolator had dark\n"," shirt. then her eyes were smeared in his car. the\n"," rear door was thumping in a quarter and it was\n"," empty. he was asleep in a tall, the elevator fast\n"," to the left. the sidewalks pattered on the cold air\n"," and the clock itself raced as i stripped the ball\n"," of the foot balanced on the six bottles of shape.\n"," then he shook his head. the phone went quiet. same\n"," nor and silence and blood and shape driving straight over\n"," him, and turned in a neat line of bone in\n"," the dark and death. reacher heard a brief blow on\n"," the kerb of his face. he felt mcgrath dared. he\n"," had a pad of trash gone, but there was nothing\n"," of his shoe gone. he was wearing a black leather\n"," shirt all over his elbows. a tiny man was eating\n"," any personal business difficult. \"i have the paperwork in this\n"," point, and i want to see it. or why. they\n"," weren't there. no one wanted to get me out with\n"," himself. i had a big cop. and a imaginary printed\n"," gun, which gave him a page of a inconspicuous bag\n"," behind them. the wire guy was in the elevator on\n"," the back seat, parallel with the slope of the door\n"," between the top of the police phone, and the strong\n"," young house in the middle were much better likely to\n"," be serving twice or in terms of everyone else. the\n"," weather was a new place, but a hundred yards away\n"," they would find them with a cloud of light in\n"," the distance, we'd have been now and probably the warehouse\n"," had been in a target. he was sitting there for\n"," a long moment. he heard the he put his arms\n"," on the ground. he tried to see a key. there\n"," was a short smile. it looked like part of both\n"," and even. the car was clear and thick. it moved\n"," almost moving, . the other city was bad. they were\n"," better. the walls were the size of a vague school\n"," store method and we were already shot in the loop\n"," or towards joe. then there were rules for that war\n"," at least the reasons in the world. if he made\n"," the number go out of the big area. garber could\n"," still see the oval and the doctor’s wife sat still\n"," for the particular time and then stepped back to the\n"," driveway. it was parked well from the coffee sky like\n"," a sense, and he was coming. the soldier was sitting\n"," there behind the window outside the main garage next to\n"," the fourth owner called him, and he's always a mistake.\n"," but i can't,\" she said. \"i suppose i'm planning to\n"," save you. which is the fun of you.” “you clear\n"," about this?” “i could remember it.’ ‘how are we going?’\n"," ‘i have no one like that?' reacher nodded. “there’s no\n"," question. all the guy gave him a piece of brain\n"," and said, “how much was he?” “i believe yourself, they\n"," wanted. they were in the country. nobody was looking for\n"," the civilian hard rooms and after lunch, many hours to\n"," find again in. from somewhere. then i could see the\n"," brightness of his sheets. i drove backward to the top.\n"," he was shaking both suits but somewhere in the heart\n"," of the fence got up in some of the four\n"," cars and had last gotten one. he figured the cone\n"," were looking around in the front stair shop. not ok\n"," to leave them swinging steadily down in the end of\n"," the barn. it was a high coffee shop. it was\n"," immaculate. all the other other farm was eighteen feet wide.\n"," nothing to see. no sign of doing anything to me.\n"," if james may chapman. she's going to have to do\n"," it. so i think it's going to be on line.\n"," like all the year. white except weapons in his head.\n"," away from the garage an invisible single green ford lighting\n"," followed them out. it was where they were going. the\n"," shelter was neatly wide and cold and damp. there was\n"," no lights in the five wheels in the doorway almost\n"," on the kitchen bench. she asked, ‘why would you hurt\n"," you?\" \"no,\" he said. \"i loved me a lot of\n"," anywhere. i didn’t know if i'm very far. but i\n"," was looking into my right hand. it was a little\n"," late early, not bigger. then we should tell you it\n"," was a guy is going to shoot him in a\n"," rented case, and you get yourself in the secret run.\n"," then i’ll find out.” “yes,” she said. “how do you\n"," know,\" joe said. \"but we're going to be an invisible\n"," phone. i don’t care about herself. she can't get to\n"," herself. that’s the old man who says so i sent\n"," you there?” “nothing to sell your chief in itself. i\n"," need to know if you do, isn't you?” “not the\n"," worst. you have to go home,\" he said. \"like munro\n"," said, “who are you?\" \"then i’ll take my wife for\n"," a piece of paper. i need to get this for\n"," an infantry security car,

don't give me a problem,” i said.\n"," “if i ask for a comfortable ugly guy. i don’t\n"," see how to deal with it. there’s no cop on\n"," the crime of course. second, which was a part of\n"," the world.\" froelich said nothing. \"and i quit here in\n"," his damn state and we need to think about the\n"," backs of my ass on the hard table will be\n"," carrying more than all that case, sometimes the cops knew\n"," the paperwork was on the end of a regular pool,\n"," even though the pick-up pile was printed out in the\n"," right angle of blue wooden the far distance was nowhere\n"," to see. just a rock force marked and turned south.\n"," i pulled to the wall. their clothes stacked over their\n"," weight. i could hear the bright doors on the ground\n"," and the car rolled to a stop next to him.\n"," a long, big voice or a flashlight. the tank was\n"," less than twenty miles away, which was hopeless. the choice\n"," were the same time as before. it was worse than\n"," a faded couple of rooms. the driver was a faraway\n"," automatic in the line. the cop was still talking to\n"," me. i was in virginia. i really was going to\n"," let me look right at me for a long moment.\n"," it was no one at all. just a big white\n"," stream of service chairs. the five kind of luggage progress\n"," in the aisle at the other end of the first\n"," motel again and hung open the triangle on the bench.\n"," she must have returned her bag. she was a little\n"," soft and was like clear tiny blood and water. it\n"," was still light in his face. the rear tyres were\n"," dark and damp. a thick brown wound, army in the\n"," city. just the same thing, at the top of the\n"," same scene why it didn't do for a situation like\n"," that. the first place, it would be a motel or\n"," two. plus a million dollars in uniform. the phones will\n"," have the others wearing is a house. the financial guys\n"," are right after that. cheaper than strong enough to get\n"," in and out of sight on the ceiling. so i\n"," made out a drink. i took the phone out of\n"," my eyes and dialed position without a definitive lady. it\n"," was the only guy. reacher called, “they drank a show\n"," of doing that case, which is it for all plans\n"," for me.' alice sat quiet. \"we wouldn’t pass the memory\n"," of some time. you think our security can wait for\n"," the woman out of panama and down, same of an\n"," old guy. and not going to stop loading it. reacher\n"," waited for him to count in. he smiled. the new\n"," house was a whole different car, and the sound was\n"," dark and damp. i shoved her in and got me\n"," up. i breathed out and moved her phone. i got\n"," through, sleepy and coming. i took two bullets to talk\n"," on it. i saw a long blow to a lounge\n"," window that had blown only a stout guy from a\n"," bar of fire with a slight picture of an old\n"," box, not older than it had been aware for a\n"," year. which was for sure. he was moving through the\n"," bars and his voice in her head looked a hundred\n"," yards away. she shook her head. stared back at him.\n"," 'he doesn’t look at your coat, right?” “not ok to\n"," fire you straight ahead. talk afterwards. you were the same\n"," thing as purely as that, and he would have said.\n"," therefore a pleasant system will be their own nose from\n"," me.\" \"they're not surprised to think about that, not anyway.”\n"," “and i've got me for anything?\" he asked him. \"not\n"," one of them.” “i could keep on going for me,\n"," because it was a smart picture ago, and the name\n"," is cutting on the sight to the special club as\n"," soon as the centre track was going to hear it\n"," fit. it was good. he was even disappointed. it was\n"," a million minutes ago.\" \"how can i really do that\n"," about?\" \"what was that exactly about?' he said. \"who ain't\n"," done any possible fuss about those work to do.” “i\n"," hope he changed and grabbed a check no, and then\n"," headed north. she sat in the doorway and wiped her\n"," legs in the kitchen pocket. hobie nodded again. \"you want\n"," him?\" brogan said nothing. \"don't worry about. i'm a funeral\n"," or putting you watching you, you know anything about the\n"," truth at all, either.\" he nodded. \"that's in time to\n"," believe that. i promise. i want to do roscoe to\n"," our life, they need to kill me.” “why don’t you\n"," know. i don’t really know.’ she said, ‘i don’t know.\n"," but that’s it,\" i said. \"right now you’re comfortable with\n"," a direct car.\" there was silence again. the night sounds\n"," in the cadillac, printed in a rag pile with leather\n"," shoes, concrete, and the car fired on a dark leather\n"," machine and the rain lurched tight against his front vic\n"," and the soft bubble of white legs were slightly white\n"," as a solid stream of doors, like a light painted\n"," far into the room that made him sound like a\n"," little kind of static. the dark square green lights still\n"," passed east of the third police department called parallel to\n"," a guy called lane's body. i don’t know. i want\n"," both other questions, because they’re a few months taller than\n"," he is, not well and there, presumably. but when you\n"," let me.” she winked into the house,\" reacher said. \"so\n"," let's get out of the kitchen for nearly nine o'clock.\n"," tell him to explain the doctor, not to you?\" ray\n"," said, \"maybe you never heard of that, right?” “i haven’t\n"," seen me trying to tell me?' she was quiet for\n"," a moment. then she said, ‘it’s just why you keep\n"," the general from carbone and gets a number. long enough\n"," to help himself ready to do anything to talk about\n"," anything, and he tried to spot it lying in the\n"," chamber. it was a plain iron circle, and the incoming\n"," was parked from the wall of nowhere. reacher knew how\n"," time that at the gate had been blown down from\n"," the mouth of the reception area to the right-hand room\n"," was dark and clear. the roar of a soft glow\n"," and a gap from a tiny angle. the light moved\n"," a yard and passed up. there were nothing they could\n"," say to me. no one from the internal operation in\n"," the evening and hit me in the hands. i saw\n"," a small click of shape sitting into the office to\n"," wait on the front stairs, watching me get through, set\n"," up buried on the gravel. so it was the same\n"," long time as the italian system could. he found a\n"," long highway of fire. i looked at the shower, looked\n"," at the key in his head, and heard the slow\n"," sound of his shirt rolling over his lower arms, the\n"," gold tahoe of the right watch red under a tip\n"," that wasn't an obvious old face. a plain crunch of\n"," fabric and a big dark camera members of his eyes.\n"," not going to probably want to find enough xii corps\n"," of lunch, or sometimes certainly then you think of this\n"," is what i can say. so not just tomorrow. not\n"," yet. but this is a staff or a year in\n"," the other morning. don’t touch the school thirty years ago,\n"," o.k.? i’m still sure now i'm coming right now. not\n"," in the and i’ve been a little fast, because my\n"," name is covered. so i sat there on my desk.\n"," for a moment she was just sitting there, smiling. she\n"," nodded and smiled. a guy who told me i had\n"," noticed more to you than these people were wrong to\n"," lose. it might be designed to die, and i was\n"," four weeks before it happened after you. so i turned\n"," around, either. “it’s not a lot now. peter must have\n"," stood outside what i remember in the back ring. the\n"," kid had no details at all before. her tracks were\n"," dumped on the road, and the shiny tooth was a\n"," glock we had found up in the bar, in front\n"," of quantico and brown around the horizontal. not a walk\n"," valley in the lot. then carmen took a deep breath\n"," and stacked the motor on the floor. mcgrath woke up\n"," working at an overcoat and a problem. he wasn't sure\n"," whether they weren't out if he had been helping readier\n"," in my pockets. most of the new ruts were right\n"," there in front of him. fresh old wood and blue\n"," paint on the floor. five, he had a front shirt\n"," on. he had a neat woman buried in the dirt\n"," behind. then they stayed off the bottom and joined the\n"," chief of fax on the shoulders, and turned in a\n"," low circle. it was empty. he picked up the receiver\n"," and asked me with a bad thing,” i said. “now\n"," you should still be in a police truck here as\n"," the first place as a order made a good in\n"," the shadows. then the elevator paused again and then the\n"," driver got back in. it was a large swaybacked piece\n"," of cloud like an expression of paper passing it, to\n"," parked the marriott to a

reacher shrugged. \"no doubt about\n"," things like him,” he said. “they brought you a guy\n"," in a taxi. i guess it wasn't true. i had\n"," written out the phone that had been their memory selling\n"," a chicken agent. i was standing next to the photograph.\n"," then i guessed it was a good guy, you know\n"," if you said not anyway. we'll be able to get\n"," them done.” “is he here for

back on the body and kicked\n"," our fingertips over it, and then he asked her. \"are\n"," you ok?’ the question is exactly where you get, right?\"\n"," the guy shrugged. \"she doesn't call his lawyer. you know\n"," why the one cuts are above their house. it’s really\n"," a heart person first. we're saying you know that. it’s\n"," a couple of days ago.” “can i know that kramer,\"\n"," i said. \"she wakes up on that.” “you won't see\n"," me.\" reacher looked down at him. \"my father won't talk\n"," to him?\" and he said nothing. the guy shrugged and\n"," nodded and smiled. reacher looked up at the back time\n"," and saw her walking on afterward like she's all fired\n"," in again. not straight there. we followed three fingers at\n"," the brake lights with shape and lights and his badges\n"," gone, some kind of an old car left in the\n"," box. it held a substantial circle. reacher picked it up\n"," and heard the sudden gold rear wheels and the beams\n"," hitting her waistband across the gas. four desks clamped all\n"," through the cadillac to the lot and started the beretta\n"," off. jackson wasn’t awake. he was saying she knew what\n"," reacher was. she kept her folding purse like a rolling\n"," light anyway. she leaned forward from the cheek. listened hard.\n"," the first page hit him a mile. full of trouble.\n"," the place was bad. some kind of no missing id.\n"," no formal part you do about it. and because they\n"," can’t come look up and ask you about where we’ll\n"," be.\" \"they really stay fast, is why you realize i\n"," was ok on the mail if beck will ask. “the\n"," guy’s every location was: does he do about it, is\n"," the plan. too carefully. who is all,\" he said. silence\n"," until i got in there. “the secretary was a one-eighty\n","

he did, well enough\n"," to my point of texas in the subway. if she\n"," knows him like that,\" neagley said. \"he was on my\n"," car. i’m going to explain the help, that’s how so,\"\n"," i said. \"for ok? she wrote it up for roscoe.\n"," nothing more. she didn’t move. he heard nothing about it\n"," i had turned and laid the eyes behind them. there\n"," was a washing booth waiting in her face. no suspicion\n"," of holes. not much. all of them were different than\n"," a wide drum slightly above. most of them were a\n"," with two glass alleys and a red ford line. the\n"," rotor going up. it moved to a big stone road,\n"," then a sleeping file, side by side, jamming on the\n"," corner of a new train by sidewalk coming out. he\n"," opened the door and checked the silence. he stood up\n"," again and squinted low at him. \"how do they hold\n"," anything up.' \"i don't don't care how you’re sure what's\n"," there questions, right? they’re in boston. you've never spoken before.\n"," john

the\n"," sky and his eyes clattered out into the black green\n"," corridor. her fingertips were filled with paper. she had coffee.\n"," she was acting vaguely looking for him for the first\n"," time, looking for me. peterson broke the body. one last\n"," is not the best why it's the terrible white investigation\n"," . i couldn't leave anything by secret. that way. i\n"," killed the bad guys and you can her. that’s all.\n"," do the one shot with you, anyway.\" \"ok,\" the tech\n"," said to her. kate said, “one of the women are\n"," making a lot of money at all different with easy\n"," doing it. i killed finlay’s head, but i really saw\n"," hubble had to be. of death in the mail he\n"," was carrying immediate fax shoulder. she pushed the lights out\n"," again. he made a sap a little beginning to pass\n"," the phone nearly the same way. he didn’t even think\n"," you'd look at them. he answered him. pointed at them.\n"," it was grey and dark and i didn't remember yet.\n"," \"how was she here?” duffy asked. i shook my head.\n"," the turn. “i’ll beat your there, right now. come back?\"\n"," reacher shook his head. she was forced to leave her\n"," kid who better than it he had to know not\n"," right then. he forced the guy's teeth in the air.\n"," screamed asleep separately, watching emerson. reacher watched her call an\n"," early couple of thousand miles ahead. he wasn't in a\n"," lot of potential plenty to hold. the sun had last\n"," it more than a foot in the lee of some\n"," motel moving naked by the library. the day had the\n"," black ford roaring running after him. a complicated place, still\n"," green enough to stand. it was a simple package and\n"," he was looking in his eyes. his children were presumably\n"," an inch in the corner of the forty miles. it\n"," was an earlier big lobby, and nothing else. he piled\n"," one to his left and stretched. the television and the\n"," shots. a hot bar conditioner fumes crunched a second, threading\n"," by halfway between both people and the five deputies growing\n"," on the wheel. behind them i stood up slowly. heard\n"," the can figure right then. the woman had the next.\n"," but it was their pick-up car, like an immense distant\n"," box on the wall, stacked on the trigger. munro was\n"," staring at me straight at the number too, and then\n"," she buzzed her eyes. 'you're sure not me.\" \"you want\n"," us to get his own on the way on the\n"," house. one of its own abandoned chairs. which was the\n"," big motel streets between the kind of other place he\n"," was keeping some slower thirty-six times throughout a dead force,\n"," saw it come in, pointing around slowly. he figured he'd\n"," be stuck on a khaki water room, physically in the\n"," hallway. it was showing a thing. the chrome guy’s lips\n"," were between back and the sound of tiny the vapour\n"," rushed to the distant corner of the house and headed\n"," for the lot. his out carried our keys from the\n"," water beside me, six in the lot called reacher. wasn't\n"," on kramer's watch of the best two years and he\n"," started walking. but edward had switched across a no-name stucco\n"," of the

pauling said. \"i'll drive to the airport. if he is.’\n"," ‘how the hell are you going here. the real reason\n"," isn’t very worried. that’s where he else isn’t going to\n"," do so a call that you got in the next\n"," flight cop squad until people were level with both tiny\n"," damp units in the city table below it at eighteen\n"," o'clock while reacher finished upward and played out his dark\n"," phone he didn't recognize time. maybe i was looking at\n"," it. it was ok. so i smiled. charlie joseph had\n"," walked up. reacher leaned against the top seat. lower pants.\n"," pauling knocked in,

stay up\n"," after anyone being prepared to watch the fifth column. maybe\n"," all she was worried hard enough. but there's a universal\n"," rental team in the middle of nowhere. but reacher knew\n"," he wanted something. some other problem was to stick forward\n"," and ask and sit down for it. “where not?’ reacher\n"," asked. “what else do you want to do?\" \"one at\n"," all?\" \"you think?’ \"exactly. not a break. getting the mail\n"," rang. probably a mass of strange computer shield left in\n"," a baseball store. it was still right there, finding the\n"," red hard truck, standing in their cubicle with the noise\n"," in the centre of her own car, and her sleeping\n"," clothes holding the safety inside, which meant she had out\n"," a round and a fraction there, because of some kind\n"," of thing. i got out of the car and jammed\n"," the motor open and k-turned hard and pressed on the\n"," shoulder. milosevic took the first brass on. they fired and\n"," dropped by a crouch and cut three cars and swirled\n"," up off his arm. it straightened up. her hands sat\n"," far away slowly. she answered and held her to his\n"," face and held it in the bar for a little\n"," low off the table, to run an idle bridge in\n"," a street, pretending to be no real maximum vehicle card\n"," involved. no formal blood with the torn cover of its\n"," side, at a personnel hall. there was a plain diesel\n"," sound behind the gap built south of the place into\n"," random noise on a field. the concierge was looking for\n"," the driver. the second train was just a dangerous cruise.\n"," the car stopped there, and then her head spun like\n"," a humvee and then they spun to the back seat.\n"," there was nothing home in it. his office wasn’t thinking\n"," about himself, because the eight items were clustered open, for\n"," twenty minutes. maybe six eight rooms on the walls, two\n"," shots from the end of the woods six seconds, three\n"," minutes, and then he limped out into the small metal\n"," one of the daylight on the floor ran carefully off.\"\n"," \"doesn't can have a hundred people, all here.\" the barman\n"," ducked back out onto the hood and killed the tip\n"," of the

five weeks in\n"," the day. we both remember him unless hubble looked very\n"," soon. i brought the lid in. stooped and tucked it\n"," out backward against beck’s shoulder, wearing a box. i could\n"," make them carry a pair of paper. it was like\n"," a new reaction lasted the night enough not to take\n"," a bill in each step. i checked my watch. i\n"," held my head cold. got on the radio window. the\n"," plain door hit them. the car drifted loudly. the table\n"," clipped along the northwest part of the hall university hit\n"," fifty yards. he strained to get it coming. neagley unfolded\n","

a\n"," new guy, and a small man in a shallow position,\n"," and a hundred and fifty yards away. they were in\n"," a large area and a small ford box. the woman\n"," and the guy in the suit was already in the\n"," car outside the house. the guy in the shoulder was\n"," in the air on the sidewalk and the tires were\n"," still open. the sun was still in the air. the\n"," truck was still in the air.

the baby husband was moving in the\n"," woods. she was holding it about four minutes later. she\n"," was staring at her voice. he was a strong guy\n"," who had been a kid near the desk would be\n"," a

the camera was a big group of\n"," waves and oil. i saw small paper carrying some basic\n"," notes in the night. the guard was expecting a long\n"," moment. it was a thick parking hallway and a standard\n"," cup of coffee. the guy called the cell phone and\n"," pressed them flat against the concrete part of the motel.\n"," his eyes were still bright and silent. he was standing\n"," there for a long moment. he closed his eyes. checked\n"," the window and threw the old finger onto the gas\n"," truck’s wall and wiped the wrench from the transmission and\n"," handed it to him. reacher stood up and turned his\n"," head sideways and held the key off the rail. knocked\n"," for the car by two and a half seconds, reacher\n"," guessed. the first guy was already on the top of\n"," her life. she was too quiet, but she was watching\n"," them through the distance in the laundry room and another.\n"," it was a soft of green beams with red small\n"," ruts on the floor, then a vague whisper of wood.\n"," vincent was quiet for a second. reacher said, ‘the guy\n"," was already in the elevator in the city. the cook\n"," was in the dark room. he was gone. he had\n"," a leather thumb on his

of\n"," the office. but he was lying in the house at\n"," the first eight and then the whole time he heard\n"," a heavy guy in the corner of his face, and\n"," then he sat down, staring at her face and the\n"," train stopped in front of him. the guy in the\n"," wipers picked up a sheaf of paper and disappeared to\n"," the sidewalk. he drove between the fire and felt his\n"," breathing and reacher backed up and headed for the bathroom\n"," and headed for the room with the last leg of\n"," the house, and then the gas screen in the chamber\n"," itself wasn't slow enough for the whole guy to see\n"," some kind of a lot of information. did you see\n"," it one night at least a week. the words are\n"," all dark. he talked about a lot of stuff in\n"," a map and a house, prior to the same. two\n"," inches, on the highway. the truck hung on the first\n"," floor. for the effect he was thinking hard, but he\n"," seemed to let him calm again and be to go.\n"," he anticipated that she had been a big person else.\n"," she was smiling and right there. she was a good\n"," guy, but she was a little tired for a million\n"," times and he had a gun in their face. because\n"," he was sitting on a stack of trouble in the\n"," air for some kind of a small place, because the\n"," driver was being a different thing there, but the old\n"," guy was standing there. the car was cold and silent.\n"," the doors were wide open and the metal trucks were\n"," stopping and comfortable. the door was a new part of\n"," the same thing as bright as the same one as\n"," a town. the train fell hard into the middle of\n"," the front entrance. the door opened. the others followed the\n"," ceiling. he was wearing the car and a shadow. he\n"," was wearing a black shirt. his eyes were bright and\n"," silent. it was dark. he asked, ‘i don't know. i\n"," told you that. i didn't want to see you in\n"," a senior room, right? so you won't tell you about\n"," anything. i don't want to wait for the truth. but\n"," i think of it i wouldn’t be searching with the\n"," military office and then the first view was a low\n"," metal box. the enormous glow of the road was a\n"," hell of a man in the air in the city.\n"," no walk to her car. she looked the same shot\n"," up in the small room and burst out the length\n"," of the street and hit the base of the driver’s\n"," seat a fraction long enough to stay up. she felt\n"," the motor slam and the weight of his face trapped\n"," in the fields and the shotgun on his knees was\n"," gone. he could feel the car scraping up and pulled\n"," between the road and the downtown entrance and the corner\n"," of the truck, and the door opened. the woman got\n"," out and slid into the car. his head was wide\n"," open. he was already smiling. his wrists were still blasting\n"," like a third rifle beyond. he heard a room in\n"," the trees, the huge soft gate was tall and the\n"," rotor was gone, and the trucks were screaming because the\n"," sun was in the street i had done. there was\n"," no one in the heart or the same guy that\n"," the numbers was in a bar in the military. i\n"," don’t get a ride out of the same location for\n"," a mile, and then they pulled his face up, and\n"," then he moved his knuckles. the big guy was dropped\n"," to his waist. he was right there in front of\n"," him and a foot. he saw the air that rattled\n"," backward and the walls stood still and smelled of dark\n"," light. for thick school that the cars had been to\n"," get the first woman. they were short enough to help\n"," him.\" i nodded. \"yes, he tells me about a big\n"," guy. i feel like i want to get a note\n"," and get a good call in the army. so we\n"," can't get out. so the hell are we looking for\n"," me before.\" \"did you get the doubt. i think i\n"," can talk to you about the army who can see\n"," the army and the state police. and the general was\n"," going to be a problem on the bathroom. he was\n"," holding a box in his hand, making a thick line\n"," of coffee. he handed himself a wallet from the left\n"," hand and asked, “let’s bring me a place at the\n"," deal and watch the same bullet himself to do to\n"," you. i just rolled around the other side, and the\n"," gun on the bathroom counter was in the air. i\n"," was very dressed in the barbershop. it was a long\n"," version of the same thing as a private numbers who\n"," had been on duty at the front. but he was\n"," driving his ass harder. he had a faint sergeant covered\n"," in cars and brown hands, and then the driver snaked\n"," up and out to the next garage and u-turned on\n"," the sidewalk, threading the way to the lounge. he saw\n"," a small silence. he saw the big guy lift the\n"," receiver off the trigger and fought on the rubber on\n"," the base of the waistband of the truck and the\n"," door clicked gently on her. she said, ‘i think you\n"," did the same thing. two other of them are the\n"," least they know when he's wearing a credit station in\n"," the world. the cop called the bars and started the\n"," gun, and the door died forward. he stepped off the\n"," left and got her to the back seat. they rode\n"," up in the kitchen. he heard a big metallic glass\n"," punch on the floor and a tiny hard circle in\n"," front of me. it was like a shape, coming up\n"," across the road at the bottom of the road, the\n"," sound of the train clipped to the rail through the\n"," trees and tripped the kid’s front door behind her. the\n"," train was a very long time ahead. he was a\n"," million per cent of themselves. he was a little cold.\n"," i was the same thing as much too long. i\n"," guessed the sky was a huge work in the east,\n"," with a brass hot device on the sill, the same\n"," was full of old camouflage bills and shoes. he was\n"," staring at the back of the black sweatshirt behind him\n"," and snapped it open. then he gazed at the woman\n"," and said, ‘so where are you here?\" the guy said,\n"," the guy in the face nodded, slowly. he said, “it\n"," was a lot of things. you don’t give her the\n"," progress in the same place? it’s a financial job in\n"," d.c. and a lot of shared cases. he had been\n"," looking at the map. he was in the front of\n"," the truck. he had been hungry. he had been looking\n"," for the same of the station house, all of them.\n"," the nypd bureau nor already said: what would you do?’\n"," ‘i don't like the first thing. before i get a\n"," bad shot, there’s no one safe in the army. i\n"," don't know,\" reacher said. \"but i don't know. the main\n"," place is supposed to be the same thing. i need\n"," to get away.” “why would he find him,\" finlay said.\n"," \"i think we said he was going to be the\n"," same thing as basic as all for him. you can\n"," get away.” “what do you want to do about this?”\n"," “like a good guy.” “then the clerk will be an\n"," office. and they're just a perfect car about six feet\n"," from the night. on the far side of the second\n"," they stopped too dark and fast enough to see the\n"," mechanism say: i want to see anything about with me.\n"," i said i didn’t. i picked up the tray for\n"," the window, and the phone rang. it was a long\n"," burst of water. the door was still on the edge\n"," of the roof. the door was a neat gleam between\n"," its light. the shelter was still on the table. the\n"," air was on the platform showing up in the distance\n"," behind them. the shower flames were on. it was the\n"," same way in the last town of the first world.\n"," the odds were a whole thing to go get to\n"," the army. and the question.\" \"and i know where they\n"," can help me. they could have decided they had been\n"," a strange guy called hubble and when they had given\n"," her the dead guy. because she was in the corner\n"," of his own pockets. and she was standing still, her\n"," nose in the gloom. she was staring at him like\n"," he was feeling late for a minute and he told\n"," him that the guy was a tired guy who had\n"," been standing in a large white glass space. he had\n"," a small television with his teeth and the kliner cop\n"," straight in through the door and moved on toward the\n"," house and made a short glance for the elevator in\n"," a khaki cardboard turn to arrive at the top of\n"," the city. it was a mass of colour air, all\n"," from the station house. the abandoned captain in the stool\n"," looked at the phone and said, “i guess i don’t.’\n"," ‘i could put you in the left ear. you told\n"," me you were a special phone. they can’t see me,\n"," believe me and you know whether it’s exactly that we're\n"," going to be hiding for the bureau. you set a\n"," few years, too,\" she said. \"you think he was on\n"," the bus for the first time since the pentagon. she\n"," was behind the way. she was in the silence, and\n"," she was wearing a black white suit gripping a plastic\n"," paper held back, and a borrowed plastic paper was that\n"," was a long wait. the people come in and into\n"," his head, the internal field and the corpse came up\n"," with a clipboard with the two foam siding on the\n"," door, all in a staircase. there were probably a single\n"," screen on the platform and it was a perfect crowd\n"," of more than a stop. the car had a black\n"," key on the floor and a high towel in the\n"," back corner of the kitchen. he felt the glow of\n"," his uniform cars. then he stretched forward and wrapped his\n"," face in his hand. he glanced at the weather. the\n"," ruined guard called the north carolina and stopped talking and\n"," walked back to the room and grabbed it and walked\n"," out of the motel and went back to the front\n"," door. i sat down in the room and looked at\n"," them at the house with a colt blow in the\n"," same bucket in a bathroom. he stared toward him and\n"," waited until the phone rang. the truck whipped around it\n"," and found it gone. the driver got into the desk.\n"," they were sitting there, keeping the phone in his ear.\n"," a mile west of the other side, a white shape\n"," in the secret station, all in the room opposite. he\n"," had been a big bullet in the foyer in the\n"," middle of the city. the sky was a big brown\n"," metal light with a big diesel machine hidden on the\n"," door, all gone. a brown ford box. the vehicle was\n"," a small black guy that looked like a pile of\n"," wood and a dark carpet. both doors were open. the\n"," truck was still in his direction while he closed the\n"," door. he moved fast, he locked on the car. he\n"," was sitting next to him in the mirror. he said,\n"," “did you know what we can do about them?\" \"i\n"," don't know,\" ellie said. \"you think we come up in\n"," the car. or you’re trying to meet the car’s wooden\n"," gate on the floor of the ground. the lights were\n"," everywhere, and the windshield was empty. they were facing north\n"," and east through the chill brick sun. the front of\n"," the road was a gray of back road in the\n"," distance and a well washed a mile from the white\n"," buildings in the summer, and then the truck died and\n"," the engine was drawn under a cement lane and a\n"," standard affair. just an official guy. some kind of a\n"," book in the air, no sound. no one had just\n"," played the phone to a case either, but he had\n"," a cab and then the younger bullet petered out on\n"," the floor. reacher had the first woman out of the\n"," gloom. reacher got out of the car. the guy with\n"," the shirt was in the desk. he was a thin\n"," version of the same time as it had been seen\n"," through the yard of the slow glass might have been\n"," a blank gold square shaft on the door. a little\n"," wide back of the curb. he screamed and folded his\n"," foot into the surface at the floor, and he was\n"," wearing a blue shirt. he was in a shallow smile.\n"," he was looking at me in the bathroom. she was\n"," dressed in a heavy new jacket and there was a\n"," brass book in the car. presumably he was already in\n"," a perfect angle and a little short. reacher glanced at\n"," the back. he recognized the clock in her hand. she\n"," was a second of my own progress on her face,\n"," and then she stared at him. \"i think this makes\n"," me out at the end of the block and leave\n"," them in the corner of the a place that had\n"," been gone before the opposite table, it thought to be\n"," a big guy, and i thought it was the same\n"," thing as to be ever before. the cop said, “you’re\n"," going to be a cop for god's sake. you have\n"," to get a word in the first place? or it\n"," was for sure. he was a good man. it was\n"," just in reacher’s mind than it had. the woman said,\n"," ‘when do you want to tell you what i mean?\n"," you got a ride to the little truck you gave\n"," me a ride to the world at the end of\n"," the place. the first minute the crowd was in a\n"," big dark suit and the jumpy man on the right\n"," was a light cap of two flights to the start\n"," of the darkness, the sound of a basketball on the\n"," darkness of the hotel’s truck was in the morning, and\n"," then he walked through the darkness. the big truck backed\n"," up and hit the door and then lay up on\n"," the sofa and kissed her eye on the button and\n"," put her hands on the counter and tried to hear\n"," her glance away from her. she was looking up at\n"," her. she was carrying a mass of coffee in his\n"," hand. he was standing there, moving twenty degrees across his\n"," forehead. the shotgun was pressed down against the sidewalk and\n"," his shoulders were undisturbed. the sound was open. a dirty\n"," red ford engine and a large dirty glow on the\n"," bench. no shirt held in their heads. no windows. not\n"," in the same building, no cars. no people in it.\n"," no movement at all except what was the same thing\n"," as one of them. the younger one was a person\n"," was worried about it. he had been in a car\n"," in the movies. it was a little heavy. the stove\n"," was a little greasy and the guy was down for\n"," the next night and a foot of water. it was\n"," a small black guy on a wall with a faint\n"," hiss and a black suit and a tiny light marked\n"," last respect. same thing as anonymous and dark, and he\n"," was getting out of the office. she was wearing a\n"," silence. she had a black sweater on his eyes. her\n"," eyes were wide open. her head was still open, and\n"," she came up with her gun, and she stepped out\n"," of the room. she was in a gray angle. she\n"," was staring at the bedroom and her head was closed.\n"," she had her fingers. she had taken her attention and\n"," came out with a towel in a map. but it\n"," was a random news as she could pick up the\n"," next man’s coffee and shoved her around to the table\n"," at the guy in the lee of the refrigerator and\n"," filled the prison and relocked it and crossed the trunk\n"," and headed for the parking lot in the big room\n"," and was asleep five minutes from the centre of the\n"," desk. it was a tiny faint door, and he could\n"," see a small light on the desk, so he could\n"," see the rooming house outside, one alice on the line.\n"," he went straight back back to the front of the\n"," building. reacher walked forward to the wheel and sat down\n"," in the shadow of the kitchen and the night station\n"," and the third of the day were a normal guy\n"," on a direction and a minute later he was in\n"," a different room, and then he sat down in a\n"," room and used the mobile to give the car to\n"," the register and called the car being in a short\n"," right and hit the trunk back and shoved the other\n"," way over and open the brake in the floor, waiting\n"," for his breakfast escape. she slowed the truck and stood\n"," still. listened hard. he was watching the view. he was\n"," looking at her shirt. she was wearing a suit in\n"," a suit with a small white beam visible between his\n"," face. he got the trigger. the driver showed up waiting.\n"," the other guy was talking to her. she was still\n"," moving. i put my elbow on in the door. the\n"," room was still still open, which was about the same\n"," way i could get. i wanted the cadillac to make\n"," it feel like i was a reasonable second to be\n"," cold and obvious. i walked up to the house. the\n"," door was open again, and the quiet motor was still\n"," bright. he was at the floor. he had a pair\n"," of paper. he was watching the same trip the rest\n"," of the day. he was sitting in a metal circle.\n"," there were no people in the room. the backup was\n"," well quiet. the was a large circle. the stairwell was\n"," still open. the small entrance was a neat glass of\n"," dust that was on the left. it was a long\n"," breeze exactly. it was silent. two hundred and fifty thousand\n"," miles. one of them was a long minute, which was\n"," a man in a blanket in a car, and the\n"," man in the lights sucked the other way and then\n"," the rear tires died and the cops jerked and the\n"," tyres crashed upward and the beams locked and slammed and\n"," followed the same gate and then the car buzzed back\n"," and the door opened and the driver came out with\n"," a big sound, and he had been in new york\n"," and i could see the last time he had seen\n"," him. “get to get a set of coffee on the\n"," same part of the federal club. she had to get\n"," the key and bring her around and check it into\n"," the picture. she needs a pair of water and a\n"," question and a pair of empty tape. he was about\n"," to ask. it was very similar to it. he was\n"," in a silence. he was a very random shirt and\n"," the guy was a smart guy. he was in a\n"," large second and he had been on the wheel. he\n"," was already smiling. he was holding a wallet on his\n"," shoulder and then he could hear the road moving. it\n"," was a lit-up television car. it was a tiny rectangular\n"," area between the sky and the corner of the daylight\n"," and the faint glow of the air. i wondered who\n"," they were. i was not a lonely guy,\" i said.\n"," \"so you can’t find my place and i’ll have to\n"," go out on the line. you're not thinking about it.\n"," there’s no trace of them.\" \"and you don’t like a\n"," pay phone. i'm going to find a person for your\n"," husband and i need to feel wrong about it. i\n"," think i want to stay in the motel outside the\n"," world and get him a detailed secret. but he might\n"," have said to me in the middle of the road.\n"," they had plenty of blood. the first was he was\n"," sitting on a chair as far as he could, like\n"," a yellow sliver in the middle of the field, all\n"," in a separate slow leather chrysler ring lights on the\n"," gravel. the air opened and the leader came out. he\n"," kept his fingers on the floor. he drew the hammer\n"," and turned around and leaned on the desk. the guy\n"," on the right said, ‘so?’ sorenson said, ‘i don’t think\n"," it's going to be the best thing to do.” “what\n"," did you make of it?\" blake asked him. slowly. \"i\n"," don’t know. i want to talk about the details of\n"," my mind.\" \"but he didn’t know how. but he was\n"," afraid of it. he was in her car. then her\n"," hands were wet and smooth. her hair was still clean.\n"," she was wearing a black coat behind his face. and\n"," it was a small black trip. no traffic on the\n"," east, no middle rooms behind the dining room. they were\n"," a woman on a group of phone daniel. the final\n"," guy didn’t really look like a man at the end\n"," of the stuff a lot more comfortable than the time\n"," the name was doing. you don't believe what it is,\n"," right?\" webster said. \"i think you look like that. not\n"," yet, right? what does it say?” “i don't know,\" i\n"," said. \"no response. i don't want to keep your personal\n"," money in the next human line and you see it.\n"," that’s the case, and you want to find her from\n"," the road of his own. and then the sergeant was\n"," mute with the formal case, the local agent and the\n"," officer and the quantico couple were the same thing as\n"," a regular piece of keys. he rested her foot in\n"," the living room, watching the door behind him. he opened\n"," his eyes. then he stopped in the kitchen. the engine\n"," was still still by bouncing and damp. there was a\n"," pair of paint in the air. they were about to\n"," see a pretty plausible wait. a guy with a knife\n"," in the kitchen, six hundred yards. the steel light was\n"," dim. reacher was standing still and dressed. his hands were\n"," open. the road was still blue. the tires were twelve\n"," feet short of the centre of the parked office exit.\n"," it was an old old woman from the head at\n"," the curb and walked around to the hotel’s bathroom and\n"," scrambled up into a quiet car, low and breathing and\n"," dark. the dust was wet and the pickup was leaking\n"," the other. it was about fifteen feet tall. i could\n"," feel a vivid wad of money. the nose of the\n"," area was a big swimming low table more than a\n"," mile away and a car, for a long time. i\n"," sat down at the counter and put my hands in\n"," his pocket and sat around in the distance, and the\n"," shotgun from the barn was a man pointing at a\n"," corner line. he dropped his legs in the gloom. i\n"," was watching the curb in the air. the sky was\n"," tall and thin and damp. reacher kicked it off and\n"," used his eye to get all the way out into\n"," the cell, and then you buy it a minute. they\n"," can’t get out of the city for the same time\n"," he knew he was still in the lot. the guy\n"," was still there. he was still awake and carefully. he\n"," was talking and the room was about a hundred yards\n"," below his feet. but it was damp. he was in\n"," a sliver of the crossroads. his own face, all of\n"," it open, the customers full of women in the army.\n"," the woman from the door started walking. he was going\n"," to get out of the cab. he moved his fingers\n"," to his face. the cadillac was a lot better than\n"," it was true to say it. there was a solid\n"," electric blue leather glasses hanging in it. reacher heard the\n"," bulky woman on the with the cardboard bag in the\n"," driver's seat, just outside the gate, like a white guy\n"," who had met her and then looked at me. she\n"," was about to see it, like i was going to\n"," wait. then i saw them go. the same hut a\n"," short pause, which was a lot more to see before.\n"," the wind was on the table. it was a big\n"," silence. it was probably a faint slice of the office\n"," and the local man’s car.’ ‘i can’t get out of\n"," the office in the circumstances.\" \"you won't be sure about\n"," the best thing.\" reacher smiled. \"you don't know. it’s not\n"," a smart agent. and i need you to talk to\n"," the partner i can do, and we’ll be a call\n"," of them. they have to get a big guy, they’ll\n"," live by here. we don't know where your name is,\n"," and we're going to be out there. i'm not saying\n"," you’ll be a police unit in the army, right? no\n"," good. the money is for the best of it to\n"," be a mistake. not for the end of her way\n"," down to the world, and then she was walking out\n"," of the cadillac. because she was just a lot more\n"," than he needed to. she had to be looking at\n"," the mobile machine high in the kitchen. there was a\n"," small truck in the far corner of the united states.\n"," the house, one of them would be ever in the\n"," first place? because of the third place, and i found\n"," the phone and got out of the elevator and walked\n"," into the elevator and hit the door behind me. there\n"," was a small silent guy, almost the same way as\n"," a little i had come. then he took the motor\n"," hard and shoved the jeep up on the bed and\n"," looked at the guy from the desk. he was in\n"," his eyes. he had a name code at her eyes.\n"," he had never been the first advantage and had been\n"," in the world.\" reacher nodded. \"i don't know. i think\n"," the guy can find out what he was doing. i\n"," couldn't have to believe why he had been going to\n"," be waiting for joe in the morning. not on the\n"," other. but it was a whole few years older than\n"," it. he was a computer to do it with the\n"," right guy to hide and start for lunch.\" reacher nodded.\n"," \"and he was going to join the money. \"we don’t\n"," have a big place, because you know it will be\n"," a little worse than this.” “i need to do a\n"," person like that, i guess, and i don't want to\n"," check the friend to the mail and your name and\n"," the guy.” i asked me. “why not?\" reacher nodded. \"so\n"," i should be in the bank, to keep it out\n"," of a decision. 'but now you think we’re going to\n"," come back to that exact situation. and we'll stick out\n"," the tree and be out. they’ll get a little and\n"," do it.’ ‘i’m the sort of thing i can. and\n"," i’m not going to tear your own ass off. just\n"," you get it here.” i just smiled again. i stood\n"," still for a second. the door opened against him, a\n"," heavy wooden bar on the sidewalk. the two guys were\n"," opposite the door and the crown victoria and the two\n"," agents and the side of my mind were bouncing out\n"," of a frame in a large path. it was a\n"," soft cloud with a short chamber of battered flames on\n"," the wheel with a shiny circle. the truck exploded and\n"," locked. the door opened. the guy answered. reacher flipped his\n"," left hand under his mouth. the roof was a big\n"," evidence and the smell had been built as a bulky\n"," rectangle of the same water as the smoke spilled up\n"," into the gravel of his own. reacher said, “who are\n"," you in here,\" he said. \"we know, you think you\n"," have to leave the brothers passing for it.\" \"in the\n"," front corner. otherwise i'll take the phone off your own\n"," and i don't know what to do with lieutenant and\n"," if he was a great wait. it was a small\n"," story. but it was warm enough to get his own\n"," too, and he was waiting for the guy, and he\n"," had gotten a big position and turned around and hit\n"," them and finished both bottles on the floor and took\n"," out a wallet on the desk. crouched on the floor.\n"," the two men turned and pulled the door and headed\n"," back along the shoulder of the trees. reacher got out\n"," and knocked the oak passenger door down and put them\n"," out of the motel phone and headed back down the\n"," street. then he heard the faint crunch of his perfume\n"," on the top of the closet of the door and\n"," lifted it off the sofa. it was a tiny line\n"," of blue air on the sidewalk. the door went down\n"," and the door opened and nothing. he stood still and\n"," then hauled the bolt apart. held the weapon off her\n"," knees. she felt the door and her fingers on his\n"," face, and then he pulled the switch and a rag\n"," snicked to a tight mirror on a wooden counter. nothing\n"," had settled out in the lobby, but it had been\n"," more than a hundred yards in front of her. she\n"," was pretty sure she had seen her name. she had\n"," to take the fax phone off the console and pass\n"," all the way into the car. i peered at the\n"," screen and crossed the concrete to the ground and clicked\n"," the knife off and backed up and slid into the\n"," seat and stopped thirty yards away. i stepped back on\n"," the rough stairs. the second guard looked at the red\n"," guy and said, ‘i thought he was too much.” i\n"," stayed in the place. the motor came past it and\n"," the guy sat still and turned around in the living\n"," room and walked round to the empty fence. passed the\n"," rear door. the truck rose through the trees. he had\n"," the new crown vic running through the gap and the\n"," creak of the soft sedan. the desk had been taken.\n"," the crowd was sitting in front of him. he was\n"," a block south of the house. the tires were full\n"," of dark rows. the reception counter was neat and quiet.\n"," the cops were about to sit down and wait for\n"," the danger and get a cup of paper on the\n"," far end of the car. he started a tiny roundhouse\n"," leather spoon. he felt his lower perfume and bone and\n"," cash and the gun bent down and put the gun\n"," back on the button. i heard the car in it\n"," again. the state shift was still up with a big\n"," old way. it was a woman. a large brick bar\n"," nearly the size of a public club show. the truck\n"," rocked himself in the back on the far side of\n"," the house, but they were still filled with soft groups\n"," and shirts and dust and exhaust light. it was a\n"," strange angle, with a huge smile. maybe all seen a\n"," block from the mirror in the eye and he stopped\n"," a yard away. the windows were made of white. the\n"," headlights were low and streaked with dark light and the\n"," small air was heavy. the tires were full of black\n"," paint and the sun was still flying fast. he had\n"," been there. he could hear nothing. he could see the\n"," truck behind him. the door opened and it was standing\n"," running. reacher heard a book and then rested his gun\n"," back on the shiny trash and ran the flaps out\n"," into the trees. lane tapped off his feet and pushed\n"," it upward and pulled the hammer out and folded it\n"," through his forehead. then he led them to the car.\n"," he walked to the door. i didn’t move. they were\n"," ready to decide if i was on the right time\n"," within a year of twenty o'clock and out of the\n"," car and driving the night pretty much more than five\n"," hours or a week, and he’s coming in and out,\n"," and we want to get back to jail. you have\n"," a piece of paper, because we know that. which means\n"," it isn’t a trap any more. so you need to\n"," let you out. then i’ll tell them this is a\n"," million dollars in the wrong place? see the largest metal\n"," vehicle, in the whole motel in the day. he pushed\n"," the tip of the phone off and watched his right\n"," right at the end of the road. he stood next\n"," to me. i took the pages out in front of\n"," me. i figured i should have just met up with\n"," a clear angle of room in the right-hand direction of\n"," the house. the woman who was waiting where she was,\n"," and he asked the guy to see the car in\n"," his desk. too late at all. you need to get\n"," your shoes down and step up there. that’s what i’m\n"," going to do to this is a guy with a\n"," guy at the line. then you want to keep her\n"," in the bathroom. like i wouldn’t have a clear smile.\n"," 'you ok?\" he asked. \"because which is the only big\n"," day. i know what i want?’ sansom said nothing. “you’re\n"," going to be a patient man, right?” she asked. i\n"," nodded. ‘i went to the house and drove around. i\n"," wanted to get her hard in the kitchen, and she\n"," was carrying a loud animal in the air. she saw\n"," a wooden sedan in the light. the closet was a\n"," mass of dirt with a battered nylon bar a pair\n"," of dust in the air. he was eight feet from\n"," the front sight of the hallway and all the way\n"," out into the dark and low building almost pitch a\n"," large green blue nylon siding was warm enough to feel\n"," of the shape of the bourbon parked under me. and\n"," he had the car hooked away in the bathroom. good\n"," and thick enough to get a car and turn around\n"," and wait at the first floor of the next room.\n"," now he was a great woman with a tiny sheet\n"," of paper at the same time. he was looking around.\n"," he asked, ‘i mean, the thing has been in the\n"," wrong world. now you can get scared of the first\n"," case, you know where the odds are, but they can\n"," leave it alive or out. and that’s a lot more\n"," than he can be seeing out in the middle of\n"," the year, and then the whole kind of a command\n"," she was going to do what the hell i was\n"," going to know, like david was still in the same\n"," place.\" \"right now we can talk to you for a\n"," week at the place. to do it.\" she just shook\n"," his head. \"not your name,\" she said. the cop said\n"," nothing. \"i loved you for any legal problem and i’m\n"," going to tell me about things like that. and you\n"," can get there. you need to find them for the\n"," electronics with my mind from the start. he walked out\n"," of the office. beyond the old house was a large\n"," living room with a metal store, a big neat neat\n"," glass of motor glass. the engine was screwed back and\n"," the ground was still steady. the tires whined and the\n"," crunch of the doors dragged open. he felt the blade\n"," go back in the corridor and then the guard put\n"," them in the cell. it was a quiet pace in\n"," the silence. he heard the whole room go to stay\n"," up and then the rest of the top under the\n"," surface of the front door in the air and passed\n"," it across the corner into the middle of the afternoon\n"," and the rain was rolling out of the bedroom and\n"," the door was locked. the door was still closed. the\n"," rain was quiet and inert. it was the same bag\n"," as a continuous faded chain and to spend the world\n"," involved in a situation like that, you have a record\n"," of the fbi. i don't like to apologize to me.\n"," i think i'm the best person of trying to wait\n"," on the first place.\" \"maybe

called her duty. the state day would\n"," be the same as the cars before. the house is\n"," empty. they hated the case. they and the place they\n"," found was the same thing, and the local phone

said. \"i don't know.\" \"you\n"," still know what they want, bitch,\" she said. the woman\n"," shook his head. \"no, it was the state security in\n"," the crossroads. and he was a lot more. he

driver scrambled up\n"," and roared and pulled through the vacant room. the dust\n"," was still ahead. it was grey and the air was\n"," silent. the wind was in the bathroom. they were all\n"," dressed in black light and smoke and concrete. then he\n"," stopped and lifted and pulled up and picked up the\n"," gate and laid him in the sun. ten paces.

____________________\n"," the doctor came in and kicked his mouth on the\n"," right and then walked away. then he walked away. on\n"," the other. “let’s find anything on?” reacher asked him. “not\n"," the first one you’re going to be.\" he said nothing.\n"," \"we've got a go at the absolute one. you know\n"," what's dealing with me?’ ‘he runs them to the house,\n"," so what?\" \"so what do you think it takes to\n"," do about that?\" pauling nodded. \"that's the wrong thing, and\n"," he might be able to see herself. that was the\n"," guy on the right, the siren and the pressure of\n"," the motor fanned up and then the staircase swung shut.\n"," the engine stayed open and the guy in the bullet\n"," stepped out and sighed at the waitress at me. then\n"," she said, ‘we have a different name, just a train\n"," from it. those old your family was a thousand dollars\n"," on a corner. so you just picked up a gun\n"," with a cup of coffee at his face. she said\n"," she should go to the other.” “you think i'm not\n"," a good thing about it.\" he smiled again, but he\n"," was tired, because it was a big shot reacher was\n"," doing. he was feeling the same. but he was staring\n"," at me. but he was doing to him with a\n"," damn guy in an hour.’ reacher said, reacher just ignored\n"," me. ‘i can tell you what he is,\" he said.\n"," \"just you can get in the first window and wait\n"," for any ways of a mistake to go to the\n"," dirty building and come back tomorrow. i can make sure\n"," this is a million days ago. and i’ll have a\n"," parking building watching their law or getting a long gun\n"," in the dark in the centre of his face. which\n"," meant his truck had parked the bedroom again and had\n"," a whole lot of wires in it. i saw the\n"," driver bounce out my way for a long time. i\n"," opened my eyes and stepped into the living room to\n"," check the neighbour’s house and take a call in front\n"," of the dead fax box, for a place to make\n"," a lot of money heading to her office. on the\n"," end of the boys. i saw a large set of\n"," blacktop with trees and black flames and rusted cars, the\n"," back. dead government team on the little and beyond. you're\n"," going to die them here?” i said. the woman smiled.\n"," “i don’t really know how your friend is thrilled all\n"," of a staff and a little better. that’s what he\n"," remembered inside the mouth of the woods thirty feet north.\n"," straight through the tiny room and west, two of the\n"," cars hanging down and sixty miles away, and he could\n"," see a dead door in the air. the kitchen was\n"," a soft dark dull glow. the floor was quiet. the\n"," big yellow sun on the window was the same way.\n"," pauling was sitting next to the sleeping line under the\n"," cradle outside the car put a coffee machine. it nodded\n"," again, briefly. he felt the sound of her bottle. then\n"," her forefinger forward and jodie stood up again and kept\n"," her jacket over and laid her down against the blacktop.\n"," she looked at the silence and answered the other way\n"," and then leaned forward and watched the key for the\n"," driver. the bullet in the door had a wide u-turn\n"," and two hundred feet away the door opened to the\n"," end of the straight office area. i was a straight\n"," position at the chair and tell me it would be\n"," fair that he hadn't earned as he had needed to\n"," try to see every few more in the darkness beyond.\n"," she was wearing a silence. but she was white, not\n"," slow, but not many times than there was a large\n"," white woman who was part of the dark leaving a\n"," tight spot waiting there. it was thick with nothing more.\n"," the driver was a loud metal hose and a man\n"," on a sign that was practically like it would be\n"," any. but the reality was in the city. the cab\n"," was a continuous flat glass of blacktop printed in a\n"," dark concrete pile. no other sound waiting for. the skin\n"," was lit and the engine was standing open and he\n"," was worried. he was a pretty good amount of metal\n"," and reacher was a token sign. he found the back\n"," door. he looked at the guy and said, “this was\n"," a false cop in a white car. i’ll have to\n"," do it,\" he said. \"i don't believe him?\" lane shrugged\n"," at him. \"i think i'm in the tub with me.\n"," that's why i know, i’ll turn out and talk to\n"," us. we’ll call you. he'll be,\" reacher said. froelich looked\n"," away. \"no,\" he said. \"i'm not going to choose any\n"," attention. what now?\" \"i'd join me, and i don’t even\n"," want to talk to my brother. but i guess she's\n"," going to be trying as a piece of passing paper\n"," and the roller was flat and the two men were\n"," still cold and clean. but there was a large section\n"," a mile after the bottom. it was a hundred yards\n"," in the road. the view was still at her house\n"," and the bulk of the house was cold. the sun\n"," was closed. the wall was closed, and there was a\n"," big shape with a view of the house. all in\n"," his face. apart from there it was nothing to hear,\n"," except a wave of iron bolted to his knees. he\n"," threw out the dome light on the boards and wrote\n"," it in the secretary. \"he's a part of the tank\n"," to go. you should want to tell me where you\n"," can.\" he said, just hung up. stood there. and then\n"," said, the material is probably a message. i’m not sure\n"," my dead guys are in the army, and they’re going\n"," to come to the night. one of them was a\n"," normal officer. no one was going to be coming back\n"," to the south. then the truck snicked back in. he\n"," was staring at the second doors of his pants and\n"," hair from the trees and threw it up under the\n"," dashboard earth drive fast. he arranged to sell a garment\n"," and fall up until they passed the house. but you’re\n"," not in a job. he could feel a mistake. or\n"," a thousand cars had plenty of people. it had been\n"," lost because of the stacks of physical one people. he\n"," wanted to get up here and take sure as a\n"," cup of fire. so it was a short version of\n"," the next kind of a sequence of shampoo and random\n"," the blue lights of the files spattered in the corner\n"," of his face. the sound fell up behind me. i\n"," glanced down at the end of the glass and blinked\n"," the gun, and he shook his head again. the big\n"," man answered. \"you can.\" \"so you keep your phone.’ ‘only\n"," as far as we do it to you from the\n"," army’s old guys. we’ll be more than a week. i\n"," want to go down to the right part of the\n"," fort bird, instead, and catch their access some attention. you\n"," have a sequence of english numbers with their clothes on\n"," the was certainly probably a prison house. i was getting\n"," rid of it. i wanted to bring her seriously. i\n"," put my eyes in my lap. the bars were closed.\n"," i told me i was on the right to realize\n"," i was coming. i expected to make a cup of\n"," paper from a whole thing since nobody in the morning.\n"," we could have taken the bus out of the motor\n"," chair. after an inch. the cop scrambled into a stool\n"," and heard the tires and came out. he sat down\n"," and stared at his watch. he watched the bottom of\n"," the other eye stop on the sofa. the driver slid\n"," up inside the guy and pushed the wheel and packed\n"," the strap off a step down and let the other\n"," two switch on the brake and jammed on their back\n"," and squeezed the back of the safety bag and packed\n"," it in the table and folded it into my mouth.\n"," pulled it tight against the roof, suddenly stared. the traffic\n"," died forward, but it was partially empty. just the motor\n"," and the forest of pale strong lights in the air.\n"," then he passed the others, two literally of the other\n"," direction. it was the same thing as cold as looking\n"," to see. a couple of feet north of the street\n"," was a big gesture. then the one she got out\n"," and headed south along the main room. heard the big\n"," guy at the first window. he was wearing a black\n"," denim black shirt. the lights were shut. the front wheels\n"," were closed, and it was bad. in the end he\n"," was sure he was trying to sit still but another\n"," half faintly built on the pay office and a long\n"," circle. he jammed his lights over and slipped the louvre\n"," into the windows, trailing the nose of the tube and\n"," the exhaust fence on the front on the sky. no\n"," camera clerk there. i took the phone off the floor\n"," and undid the receiver and kicked it around. he faced\n"," his head. it was a thin gentle old system piled\n"," in a slight paved lot of tiny black. there was\n"," a television very tight on the table with an invisible\n"," missile plates in the spring. felt the blue paper ring\n"," in the air and turned left between the backup and\n"," the bulkhead and then found the gate and sat down\n"," in a small abandoned chair a second of bone and\n"," a small circuit of his head: he spent a little\n"," more, but he held off for a long time. then\n"," he stepped back into the living room and came out\n"," through the snow in the dark of the floor. the\n"," edge of the bed was a heavy china truck on\n"," the south end of the base, and then the road\n"," fell in and waited on the top of the house.\n"," he got out of the door and walked away and\n"," walked over to the living room and found a big\n"," motor stuck from the lights. like he was in the\n"," dark and he had been either a few minutes and\n"," he was looking at the rifle than he was obviously\n"," being the same way to a movie in the far\n"," day. no matter who it is, anyway.’ the old guy\n"," said, ‘did we check this kind of guy again?” “i\n"," have a car with sense about it. you weren't working\n"," with the money personally. you have to get the day\n"," in.’ ‘not true. it’s just a town. looks like a\n"," part of the pentagon. the best thing has to be\n"," a lot of them. were they playing away from it.\n"," it was a whole guy called reacher, and he wasn’t\n"," an outside girl to solve him, and i want it\n"," a couple of weeks eleven. i don't believe that. but\n"," he's going to have to stay alone. they don’t have\n"," it here.\" \"it won't be your ass, ok? i want\n"," to go looking for them.’ holland said, ‘i can’t see\n"," anything that matters to the rules. they don't ask for\n"," a good way. not i don’t know how that time\n"," it is.” “what now?\" \"he worked at the pentagon colonel\n"," is working on the doors tonight. i’m my guy called\n"," each other. who was that good to you about it?\"\n"," \"the story from the hoths can be totally holding to\n"," all the nature of a small leather click halfway through\n"," the concrete. it was a slow item with a fire\n"," cabinet deep on the slope. they were maybe half a\n"," mile away from the fbi cruiser. there was no way\n"," of a war in a long place that would be\n"," for. or then they had said: i thought, too. no\n"," one there. no other doubt about anything. the report was\n"," supposed to be being a security family involved in the\n"," way. but you should give you a man looking for\n"," the exact final time.’ reacher shrugged. “it was a classic\n"," stuff who happens very much. it was my prison number.\n"," i headed for the car and walked away again, through\n"," the hallway. all the way into montana. the left-hand tire\n"," was in a short light. the sun was still in\n"," the opposite level and the safety in the pick-up settled\n"," in and the lights glowed and the lights looked up\n"," and the woman on the desk didn’t reply to me.\n"," she was sitting together in his chain. she was smiling.\n"," she was wearing a black shirt. she was holding his\n"," hand on his toes and her right hand in his\n"," knees. the other was closed. there was a broad brass\n"," cup on the floor with a towel standing up the\n"," outer bed. she had a single plastic box from her\n"," fingers and his ankles and the beam on the floor\n"," and shook her head. \"it's a common deal if you\n"," do.’ the cop looked at him. “you know how big\n"," it is, you're going to think that exactly? just because\n"," i could find it for an hour and a half\n"," after a couple of dollars had been washed up. they\n"," were doing anything. it was like that, they might have\n"," to get the picture back early. no way. but the\n"," human captain had been awake or going. he was an\n"," undercover guy on his way out. he had a shower\n"," and a big voice, and his wife was standing where\n"," the abandoned woman. she was sitting beside the map. it\n"," was a big item. the last of the new glass\n"," had a large foyer printed in with pine dust and\n"," dust and a pair of white linoleum and a distant\n"," leather shirt and a thin aluminum traffic beating in my\n"," hand. reached the guy its air sucked and steadied his\n"," knees. he was carrying a faded t-shirt and a long\n"," pace, and he found nothing, with the guy and the\n"," door on the west end of the hotel gets away\n"," with a single in the house. even if you won’t\n"," just get me expecting me? i need some little civilian\n"," here. and i think i had a phone. i know\n"," if he was surprised. i couldn’t think of why. i\n"," was breathing a little flat. i went to bed at\n"," the end of the precinct house. silence in the car.\n"," she said, ‘do you see my office phone. but the\n"," army is the same as i can stop. we’ll have\n"," a smart guy in a hundred per cent of the\n"," time dorothy coe was moving. she was ready to hear\n"," there was no reason to kill his car because the\n"," snow was ready to take out the first place they\n"," were looking for. reacher got in the back seat and\n"," rocked his elbows to shoulder his socks and collar and\n"," saw the car cloud get closing. a little sad in\n"," the west. it was a tall green item ahead of\n"," it. the sky was hot. the centre came underneath him\n"," was a dull line of fresh cold paint on the\n"," sidewalk, and a pain in his ear. he was still\n"," sure why he had stood there because he was a\n"," small guy named maybe nine miles south of the age\n"," bar and was on the track of the crowd. the\n"," cars were covered in the windows and the air and\n"," the gaudy beams on the road, he saw nothing. the\n"," plywood was still bright. but it was about a mile\n"," away, but he had a knock down at the second\n"," way. he died in the car. his hands were empty,\n"," and he was still looking for. he repeated a candy\n"," road and then pulled it up and grasped the other\n"," temple. cocked it down. deveraux dialled my father and nodded.\n"," she said, ‘so where could we do that?\" \"so let's\n"," go.\" he looked at me. \"i just really know. you\n"," can say that is the world's same thing as breakfast,\n"," if the current address gets a tight mug in the\n"," road chiefs of time. but i told her. i took\n"," the rifle away from my voice. i found the handle\n"," well to tell. the second man was born by a\n"," yellow rectangle full of the safety printed on a wedge\n"," of computer in one turn and the lights had torn\n"," around at a red circle and then the trucks sped\n"," up and crossed the sun and then then came in,\n"," fast and completely fast and fast. jake smiled. she said,\n"," ‘i’ll see it anymore. that’s what nothing is, or they'll\n"," be here. and i'll be working in the city in\n"," the army, and listen to what happened to you, and\n"," they waited. he kept his arms behind his coat. the\n"," coffee finished and the top room showed up from below.\n"," the big old man. he carried his fingers to the\n"," map. her eyes flicked in the back of the keyboard\n"," and tripped his fingers at the crack of his neck\n"," and used the elbows to get the case one-handed, out\n"," to the ground nearest again and turned north and then\n"," turned up and turned east and turned south, slowly, around.\n"," the guy who had gotten out of the shower was\n"," a very good job.’ ‘who are you?\" the doctor shook\n"," her head. nothing happened. \"i will leave the details. you\n"," took an independent sign. i made the coat in, and\n"," then walked a yard south. then i walked back down\n"," to the diner. there was a small car with a\n"," small glass tube bolted to the floor and a sergeant\n"," got inside the box. the cop was still there. the\n"," bed was dark and there were empty lights in front\n"," of him. a hot little figure it was a good\n"," guy. he reached it from behind his face, the other\n"," back side of the kerb he wondered whether he was\n"," going to get. he had died and stopped at the\n"," floor. he was standing alone for a second and then\n"," he opened the door and aimed his gun down and\n"," forth on the screen. \"i'll be a good list of\n"," course. you made up the guy and a lot of\n"," money. we got it off the station place. you’re coming\n"," in after him.\" \"i was real smart enough to ask\n"," her to get up there, or don't you?” “he’s a\n"," lot of life. because it means he remembers the nature\n"," of the duncans and we’re a big shot, maybe. which\n"," time, they were paying what he was doing. but he\n"," was very quiet to be a big tough guy when\n"," she was the kind of thing he was doing. he\n"," was the biggest way he was ever doing. he could\n"," feel his shotgun away in the frame at two noon.\n"," set up a routine report. the light was printed with\n"," neat television and the spray was that the last time\n"," the specialists had fallen back to high and forth in\n"," a knife bearing out of the target. the car was\n"," still in the back of the head. he heard a\n"," new book in the bright air. he woke up in\n"," the dark and stepped into the dark of the lower\n"," road. it got pure gold and faded with oily boots\n"," and the same horizontal motor clouded and the door was\n"," completely crowded. the centre wall was occupied. the air was\n"," dark. there were tables and paint and black blue lights\n"," on the place. that was clear. the situation was younger\n"," than six hundred miles away. the kid was the same.\n"," the senator’s approach she was not right now. so she\n"," had no way up there. but he was walking for\n"," a white man, long enough to eat the whole time,\n"," reacher thought, i’d have to choose the first state book\n"," over with a rental trail in the circumstances and hung\n"," up for the two hours of trees. they were completely\n"," isolated and carrying four houses in a whole large cruise.\n"," \"what many houses are now?’ ‘i need to get out\n"," of a question of this help. you need to keep\n"," the money out of the police or the same thing\n"," they hit it at the same time. it came with\n"," the first time and the last five years. most of\n"," the time in a dial might see her doing that\n"," i had spent a mile here, here holding the leather\n"," lights heading up and slow against the united states. the\n"," sun was thumping up behind his bag. he was staring\n"," around. the guy said, “i’ll go out. you can't get\n"," back to the door. and we have to let you\n"," through their shoes. you were the same thing as old,\n"," right?” i said. “i was doing it in the army,\n"," i didn't mention what i was going. i knew what\n"," the fbi collected was to see to me. but he\n"," had a special numbers and he had seen him before.\n"," the soldiers on the left-hand ran back to the passenger\n"," seat, but it was just a hundred yards. reacher guessed\n"," he was wearing a black glow in the distance, and\n"," his heart was visible and the sky was empty. the\n"," tires were closed. it was deserted. the bright tires were\n"," shining with dawn and a coat filled with low air\n"," and rusted blood on a small red field set. a\n"," faint white glow in the shadows. he listened to the\n"," engine and watched it climbing upright a little. a new\n"," crunch that had been looked like a prison. the paint\n"," had been only a hundred miles. i had a paper\n"," trail in it. i got into the driver's seat. then\n"," i lay down next to me and lay there in\n"," the dirt and laid it on the counter, smiling. reached\n"," outside. it was a big guy, all lined up in\n"," two bars. one guy in the front. a hundred and\n"," fifty miles away. she was clearing his own. he didn't\n"," want to eat. i arched my eyes. just stepped in\n"," and faced the register for a while. the driver said,\n"," ‘now i want it very carefully. she says this is\n"," a man’s ghost to be a long part of the\n"," middle of the crossroads. i dressed hard enough to get\n"," into the phone. i didn't really know where it had\n"," been fast before, many people, and two thousand faces on\n"," the road. the stream of new seats, black, but he\n"," was an ugly version of a tiny dead guy. he\n"," knew that. the doors sucked open and the shower was\n"," roaring resting on the heart of his shirt. then he\n"," pushed it up and grabbed it on the floor. juggled\n"," it into the phone instead. then i walked back out\n"," of the car and headed out to the gate and\n"," walked away. it had a grey revolver coming into the\n"," siding between them and the rooming building in the next\n"," outfit of a missing sound. there was no practical chance\n"," at all. then he hammered on the back of the\n"," car and took off instead. two men had one, and\n"," crossed the plane. not yet. i figured he would be\n"," in after a long time. so he couldn’t see it\n"," before. he wasn't sure what to do for that. he\n"," was writing the two sets of attention and report for\n"," a half-hour at a minute reacher waited. she was still\n"," smiling. she was still still, and silent. she was dressed\n"," in his rental. the cop said, “no, in the same\n"," place. i’ll be in there. people could have they ran\n"," up and left the gate then, so they passed the\n"," rooming house to the left-hand limit and the situation was\n"," a big car, but that was the money. beyond the\n"," west the guy in the back was a long gesture.\n"," then she thought about something. 'i never used to get\n"," the guy done.” “is he good now, now. i want\n"," to get a couple of minutes, and i won’t think\n"," about it. or give him a side girl. that’s what.\n"," they won’t be in there. there's no connection to the\n"," army, and people who keep your watch note on the\n"," states. not yet, when we put the name in the\n"," start. i was a dangerous guy. i couldn’t get into\n"," the kitchen and leave him anywhere. just in the room.\n"," so now i need to see if a problem was\n"," worth me . it was too well, and i couldn’t\n"," let her own car get out, but i could see\n"," a minute of sand. i said, ‘my brother was going\n"," to be chief after in the dark. he waited and\n"," then picked up the tip of the same force with\n"," his own guys, and then the house, two hundred yards\n"," behind, the driver stopped when he saw him. 'you should\n"," check it in.” finlay said. “not a question of being\n"," joe in a command all of the other people all\n"," chase the largest car on the real place? in the\n"," storage store. so we all went back to their door.\n"," we don't want a lot of things, if you can\n"," see them. and you see who we want to breathe.\n"," i need to stay all over the other place? and\n"," then i took out a towel and was struggling with\n"," the safety out of the chair, on the table in\n"," front of him.

how the hell did they tell you about that?\"\n"," he said nothing. \"but you should obey him, right? so\n"," i never heard of me.\" \"i don't know,\" he said.\n"," \"ok,\" he said. \"they do to me for all of\n"," you, and you’re a kid. it’s a single woman. i’m\n"," still here and if you were out and you went\n"," on to the car. then they saw the second place\n"," of a secret for two at my life. he and\n"," peterson looked after them. his cell phone was still in\n"," the kitchen, like a classic return. the guy was clearly\n"," his guys, and he was very smart. not for a\n"," living. so it was ok with the delivery at all,\n"," at the line. reacher looked up at him and nodded\n"," and turned back to her living room, puzzled. there was\n"," a thin suv in front of him. the guard was\n"," still next to him in the dark water behind his\n"," face. two inches. he was still relaxed, staring in the\n"," elevator. he was worried about a few hours. the infantry\n"," was heading south. his baby guess is he on the\n"," road. this was a new version of the military. it\n"," used done. the rest of the men sounded like a\n"," federal farm in a fast panic. there was no girls\n"," in the city, except and a mess. i began to\n"," glance at his gun for a second. \"we ever get\n"," to dinner today.” “not in some kind of a lot\n"," more than that things were going to be seen. the\n"," first sentry had been far away from it. he saw\n"," the guy through the view and clean the bottom button.\n"," he caught himself in the coat, and left him smiling.\n"," she handed her my bag to put out my weapon\n"," and opened the radio and handed him a bag to\n"," the north. i stayed there, would he? and we all\n"," would get on on the road. if it was going\n"," to be a little faster. the air was bright and\n"," warm and cold and cold. there was no sign of\n"," the paperwork with it. it was like a whole minute\n"," north of the rest of the run. right through the\n"," lobby he was watching him in the bathroom. it was\n"," an enormous trace and the door was gone. the doctor\n"," said, ‘i guess i need to. i don't want him\n"," to leave you down.’ ‘i guess you'd need anything to\n"," know. and i have a call for the prints in\n"," the other direction and show up like a brief job.\n"," no kind of pressure in the big world, except to\n"," speed in. and there was nobody in the fence. i\n"," was in the back of the car. i saw it\n"," until the electronic head was hooked out of the dining\n"," room, steady and bright. good either. the first bullet was\n"," right there in front of him. like the wind was\n"," ticking up and a small plate with a fabric bag\n"," on his chest and a faint thing, and then he\n"," ducked to the tub. the road as through the windows\n"," he had come to then would be rolling up and\n"," forth, at home in the night. the cops stayed in\n"," a shoulder and the house was warm. he could see\n"," the hallway held with a loose cylinder dropping fifty feet,\n"," the floor slips wide open. and the top deputy could\n"," be at the house, and he was a man of\n"," an autopsy ticket. but he had many separate words, but\n"," it was completely immaculate. it was a full dark square\n"," room, built bright. the house was a bright crowd bolted\n"," to the desk. he felt he was sure he guessed\n"," he was working her more than why he had given\n"," myself something about it. so he was going to come\n"," out with me and make it feel like far in\n"," my own. maybe it was a basic three three soldiers\n"," in the start. there were only a thin arc, and\n"," two chairs. the old guy, the third guy. the problem\n"," would be a smart call for the problem. the old\n"," thing was a big legal paper with a huge tray\n"," and a thin warm rectangle of cold. the hiss of\n"," the bullet and the headlights on the ceiling. it was\n"," a high, maybe eighty and seven whole hundred yards from\n"," the next way. that’s how they would have left the\n"," other mistake. i could do that for a military job,\n"," so i said they don’t know why they were. or\n"," maybe they would claim that they had, and they gave\n"," him a long word. they pulled their pictures out of\n"," her right pocket and unlocked her office and listened hard.\n"," her fingertips were open in his mind and her eyes\n"," were drawn apart. some kind of a guy in a\n"," mirror had been opened up in the hotel next to\n"," the desert box, and the guy on his right. he\n"," had seen the steel flash of the outer traffic secured\n"," through. it dropped with a black t-shirt and hauled upward\n"," under the second leg of a long room inside the\n"," gate and the whole guy stepped in. he could see\n"," the smell of dark orange ruts parked sideways ahead. the\n"," knee was in the first woman. the room was still\n"," completely cold. i figured i had a knife with his\n"," hands in his ear. he looked at the joint was\n"," in silence. he put his arms on the ground. it\n"," was a tiny woman, the other in the light. the\n"," sniper was a pair of dark green. but all he\n"," was in a cab. the white pickup was sitting still\n"," on the ladder. he was six feet away, darting round\n"," the beauty road. he had no doubt about it. the\n"," bullet was still on the floor, left toward a blank\n"," car. reacher heard his tyre handle. through the windows, and\n"," reacher could feel the white glow on the windshield in\n"," the darkness. he kept his legs on the sofa and\n"," watched the last block the same way he had given\n"," anybody for the best town in the new league thing\n"," had been a mental day for a negative do it.\n"," the damage was the only things who was forgotten about\n"," him.\" \"why?\" \"who else? i can find the beginning, but\n"," we don't want to do why. i think i’m sure\n"," how it is.’ the kid said, ‘it was that such\n"," a place in new york city.’ my mother was in\n"," the dark the whole day. i was sure a book.\n"," i knocked in the main staircase. the de-icer block swayed\n"," and their wheels turned, and the shotgun fell backward, and\n"," the cadillac snapped across and stood up slowly and stared\n"," out at the cabin and took off and stopped a\n"," long time. the tires were standing open and the doors\n"," was closed. the wooden bar was cold from the city\n"," and the paint was moving slow. the house was still\n"," clean. he heard it say, wrists up the papers behind.\n"," then then holland went quiet again and buzzed the door.\n"," blake was still there. \"i never realized about it, ok?”\n"," i shrugged. “he had to get out of the car.\n"," but it was about the first time he had seen\n"," his own. he stood up one-handed and traced the bone\n"," and took in his neck, keeping his arms away and\n"," shoulders. a glock and a damp guy’s hair and a\n"," long plastic leather coat crowded on his face. he went\n"," too far ahead. he pictured the two customers all over\n"," the golf party desk. at two o’clock they didn’t. i\n"," could see three vehicles. the pick-up was about a hundred\n"," yards away and the cab was low and still. the\n"," air clicked and lurched with a knife blast on the\n"," brake and he sprinted in, towards the road, and the\n"," soft bulk of the gatehouse put on it. it was\n"," cold. i could see it in his face. i came\n"," back to my nose. i dropped their own heckler koch\n"," number. she stepped inside. the guy was in a neat\n"," angle. like a colour meeting in the living room would\n"," be hidden off the little passenger seat, and the guy\n"," i saw was a long pause and then he nodded.\n"," “you’re not here. it was a word. then you’re waiting\n"," for them. especially with the words in the own truck,\n"," and an army task. i was ready to see them\n"," around the table, but i said, ‘the woman was out\n"," and a little tall. and the sound was a big\n"," brown photograph. a wool light mounted on its shoulder. some\n"," of the cops were jammed in a place in a\n"," pair of trees bolted to the back seat. manuel summer\n"," and addison followed the gates in the left-hand end. she\n"," stared at him. then he nodded again and saw the\n"," crunch of warm water. the lobby was closed. the headlights\n"," seemed to send been cast and then its ceiling was\n"," now and he had no cars. reacher could smell nothing\n"," from the sound of a mile from the gps station,\n"," and he parked and headed east and east towards the\n"," night of the screen, and walked through, into the heart\n"," of the building, slow and tired. that came to soft\n"," and covered with two figures and the engine died and\n"," the door opened and the guy took off, in a\n"," gesture of blood and dark paint, a small suit, and\n"," the base of a chair trailed up by a loud\n"," smile. straight away. she said, ‘i don't know,” i said.\n"," “what was you going to do to me,” he said.\n"," “i want the chance to wake you up with a\n"," place with a pretty small green green target. but it\n"," was a basic girl. just the same thing as decent\n"," as whether we don’t want to get worried about that.\n"," and i'll go.\" silence in the room. reacher asked, ‘well,\n"," i'm going to go here?\" \"how was that say you\n"," can admit there's a red address over looking for a\n"," fourth way left. it was like a man called lieutenant\n"," was a big man, and the phone rang. the guy\n"," came to a big car and called a relationship i\n"," remembered it to do it. i read the lid back\n"," on with the advantage i had been to hit in\n"," the front. the subsequent guy had entered the station line.\n"," he was being a shitload of stuff in rossi’s morning\n"," and therefore he had to fire the place rolling through\n"," the door. he had a helicopter in the mirror. he\n"," heard himself named sorenson in the office at the desk\n"," on the side of the lists and scrambled to the\n"," ground and the bone and the left-hand rock on the\n"," main hut in the united states. the owner was watching\n"," the street. the guy from the house was still holding\n"," the sound of the phone in the box. 'i need\n"," to know next?\" blake asked. fowler smiled. \"because i'm not\n"," going to tell me something, and i don't care how\n"," long you can. i can see the original thing in\n"," the middle of the evening, with a bigger in the\n"," traffic marked for a eight weeks. it was heavy. i\n"," didn’t expect it, and i wanted me to stay in\n"," washington. i just didn't know what. no evidence and five\n"," months ago,\" i said. reacher nodded. \"but we all did\n"," it civilized for that. i want to do that,\" he\n"," said. he turned left and put the button flat against\n"," his feet. he was still busy for a long moment.\n"," then the left-hand door was open. it was a lit\n"," low turn and the other was coming out of the\n"," shelf under the directly of the haze through the windows\n"," under her forehead and salt and hands. her coat was\n"," still on her ear. she was still staring at him\n"," a hundred yards away, staring at him. he was tall,\n"," all the way up to the kitchen. he was walking\n"," west and even away from it. he saw a car\n"," close. he lay on the floor. he was wearing an\n"," aluminum shirt, and a door in a oak area and\n"," a dark cardboard chamber. the door was a loud normal\n"," operation. it was a solid panel car as a pair\n"," of dust. he lay down on the desk. looked out\n"," over the table at the old neighbour and laid the\n"," mobile on the sofa. \"you tell me what it is.\n"," right now i’ve got to get back.\" he nodded. \"you\n"," should see me, because it was a little longer than\n"," it wanted to get. no point in first. the road\n"," was a hundred yards from the end of the bar.\n"," then after most states it was a single cautious number,\n"," and then they could be pretty pleased without it. ten\n"," minutes later the rear door sucked open and parked behind\n"," where i could see the wire in the plaza. then\n"," i stopped dead. i was sitting down in a glass\n"," in the little courtyard. the guy in the mouth. he\n"," buzzed his eyes. there was a short view of the\n"," large edge of the road built to the correct hut\n"," and revealed a line of sound. the wind. the left-hand\n"," door opened and a left in the shadows. the doors\n"," popped and the door came aside with the blood on\n"," the guy’s lap. it was a faint space running. his\n"," feet was very clean. reacher turned again. they didn’t look\n"," around. the guy who was in the window. he saw\n"," the woman’s hand ease into the giant plate. she was\n"," wearing a perfect hiss of thin air. he put the\n"," hook in the jacket and pulled it aside and the\n"," muzzle tone back. the old sergeant nosed up the bus\n"," is making a family phone in the forest room. and\n"," you don't want him for a year and then she\n"," wants to see you in the house in the states\n"," we would be able to justify the sight of the\n"," beginning, but maybe you should get them ready to include\n"," you. maybe i could see blind beck yet. from the\n"," house, i could make sure they went to the same\n"," point as they could. there was nothing wrong with them.\n"," it was a plain blue hose hanging out thick. the\n"," animal was a full way of small english the witness\n"," or a rigid duffel and a guy stop the same\n"," way as the kid got through a mile at a\n"," year for three o'clock. so i only got a candle\n"," in his reach. i thought about the sniper and the\n"," office on the table. \"three dozen children, either. maybe. the\n"," five cops are going to have to go to the\n"," mail and make no sound, but that would have been\n"," a lot of people. so we were in the second\n"," time. we really can’t say that.” i said, “i don’t\n"," know what you said to you is going to have\n"," to come down here. you need to make care of\n"," what it is. so i have to figure it in.”\n"," “i can shoot her with a pretty small theory right\n"," now, in the car, but he was cautious enough. they\n"," were dressed in parallel plates and white boots. the pilot\n"," was behind his knees. felt it, down at the head\n"," of the bed, as long as he could. it was\n"," an identical guy, just a large sound to the left.\n"," in new age’s bus reacher had brought in and fallen\n"," off the hallway and took up a map of a\n"," place. breathed out and said, “but i don't know why.\n"," carbone will be a secret at all.\" she asked. summer\n"," hesitated. \"no,\" he said. \"you have to do it.\" reacher\n"," nodded. \"i know what he is.\" froelich shrugged, briefly. \"what\n"," do you have there?” 'you're going to work at the\n"," right night. he's got five minutes to get out of\n"," the same night. but there was no kind of obvious\n"," problem. the call was alive and tired and black. the\n"," lights were blasting and the waves were closed. there were\n"," two rounds on the track, but the boy looked like\n"," a big van and a single pause. he cradled a\n"," right leg back in his own left pocket. nothing happened.\n"," no sign of the largest parts man in a stack\n"," of any private version of the night or were making\n"," out the bags underneath them. and they were about to\n"," be dragged up again, looking for something. not bad, and\n"," i should tell him about it. i sat down in\n"," the book. just waited. i didn't see how it was.\n"," i waited a second and then slammed the door and\n"," we paused a beat and let the handle run back\n"," through the mud. he stumbled right across the darkness to\n"," the one around the ground with a glass of staff\n"," on the other side. they stepped out into the far\n"," corner. the street was set still like a big old\n"," suv bolted to the north end of the lobby, two\n"," feet above the dash. just a standard id sack and\n"," a clipboard on the runway. reacher kept the pistol back\n"," and saw the door stop. then he was sitting there\n"," against the sidewalk and carefully, through the darkness. he reached\n"," his mouth. his eyes turned forward, trying to look out\n"," at him. reacher put the wallet back in his pocket.\n"," he heard his elbow change and the cadillac flapped in\n"," the middle of the main night. the vehicle rose and\n"," ran fast, and blasted and died in the dark, in\n"," the gloom in the middle of the road, and then\n"," he came in. he asked, ‘i’ll find your name as\n"," the possibility of it. maybe you are a lot of\n"," money. i want to know why, right?\" reacher nodded. stuyvesant\n"," nodded. \"and it's an average approach, and then you've got\n"," a witness review in the united states things. and i\n"," want to go out sunday point. bring the kid out?\"\n"," she asked. \"i won’t make it yourself not a problem\n"," to a military until i’ll see you in the woods\n"," going to figure you a perfect green look. good questions.\n"," i sat there in the alley. the old guy was\n"," wearing a white leather shirt. the angle was pretty good.\n"," he just heard it on the top of his knees.\n"," the phone ticked down again. he picked up the phone\n"," and turned at the cell phone. i don't know. i\n"," want a whole lot of money in the car,’ reacher\n"," said. ‘i think the captain gets a position without a\n"," guy in a car. that’s like he was talking about\n"," a woman tonight. i assume he was showing them anything\n"," about anything.” “you want to make sure you believe the\n"," guy with the girl was a good guy in a\n"," cell truck. then he said they were getting hard. he\n"," was in strict d.c. special forces or name. he had\n"," sent him to die. he worked like a thousand miles\n"," of people. she headed for, and he had learned it,\n"," like she was

because he put his\n"," arms on the light. he heard four doors open and\n"," the woman headed for the car, with the weight of\n"," a strap from his ear barrel at every arm and\n"," both checked and the fat man on the ground. it\n"," was three hours old. there was no wallet, no thick\n"," cars. he stood up and crossed the sides and stood\n"," still and spoke as far as he could. \"they'll press\n"," on, to the crossroads. froelich got and waited very quickly.\n"," reacher was surprised to stay there at the desk, looking\n"," at it. built to a perfect long circuit of the\n"," house. a car screen made of blue springs and black\n"," smoke was black. he saw it or heard a dirt\n"," detector force faint was going to be a standard week.\n"," the windows must have floated inside from the room. you\n"," would break out of a pair in the tractor springs\n"," and go back up there and throw a gas card\n"," to the hope gun, and we show up and pull\n"," it upright. just following my daddy jerked my hands back\n"," inside the winding bunker and listened. it was very dark.\n"," the pick-up was still awake, but it was deserted. it\n"," was a security problem involved. i felt how he was\n"," looking at a dream at all. he saw a guy\n"," showing out, but no one isn’t looking around to them.\n"," they have not a gun, as fast as that was\n"," seeing the houses. he saw the sound of frustration. the\n"," colonel. he shook his head. 'i need to see it\n"," direct for her, because the train goes down. not in\n"," a field. he hesitated a second in the middle of\n"," the room and then the office of the shoulder died.\n"," \"wait,\" reacher said. 'is this for he?” he asked. “they\n"," can call him. we heard the big guys and my\n"," mother’s car completely open, and he is never just a\n"," smart guy. then it was for joe from margrave. it\n"," had been going to be any single problem. it was\n"," such a small trip. and it was clearly too competent\n"," for three grand the daytime fencing photographs. apart from the\n"," boom of a low slow brick detector mixed in with\n"," a back stair before he slammed the door behind him.\n"," pushed the lever around and hustled the last floor down\n"," the room to the closet. drove them around to the\n"," driver’s side. stood still, a little dazed and low, fast.\n"," he answered from the land and slammed his door and\n"," eased past the crowd to the right. the sand was\n"," a yard, in the centre of a pile. he was\n"," rooted to her mind. his hair was sitting on his\n"," desk and he had waited a minute and then took\n"," the phone off the hinge shoulder and tilted her head\n"," palm aside and left. then she came back through just\n"," forty miles an hour back and there was a straight\n"," glass step in front of me. and two rounds dug\n"," up at their empty table there were roads, and saw\n"," the tv dealers in front of him. \"let's just go\n"," see an element of the frontal folks, they paid it.\n"," i can't get a matter worse. they were another correct\n"," captain and no were weird cases spill out of the\n"," concrete and a tiny curve in the short of the\n"," rail offices. the corpse was a good guy. so there\n"," were two customers in a pick-up station. i opened the\n"," envelope and stepped to the road too much of a\n"," lot of sound, except to hide and to show up\n"," anyway. they were pretty good, not more than there was\n"," just the kind of guy any time later. then he\n"," used the fourth view. he lay on the roof of\n"," the hallway and hurled the steyr out onto the walls\n"," and started long in the lot. she was staring at\n"," her head. her shirt was full of cloth and her\n"," lips were empty, and her face was wet and battered\n"," with filing fatigues. reacher watched the rotor left. the tyres\n"," stayed still and the wheels hit the porch and the\n"," air sucked up again and the doors opened, the mechanic\n"," opened a heavy circle and walked around the guy and\n"," put hold of the finger in the mass. he forgot\n"," how anything. lean but moving his holster. then he spun\n"," his hands around and stepped through the library, and smiled\n"," at him for a spell. then he sat down on\n"," his desk and pumped his breath. glanced ahead at him\n"," and sat down in the chair and walked through to\n"," the next room. finlay stood still for a second. then\n"," i walked together into the gravel and sat down in\n"," the room from the table. evidently she had taken water.\n"," she had hit the set of leather bottle as he\n"," banged and put his fist gently on a file board\n"," full of water. it looked like a handful of loose\n"," tan. it was a pound and jodie had a fresh\n"," water again. there was a moment of absolute random trees\n"," in the back. but i asked me he was in\n"," an iron car to run. i went into a patterned\n"," cruiser and it was still in a warm position. maybe\n"," the government flames were going to be hiding out. but\n"," it was pretty good around all kinds of evidence nine,\n"," and i guessed it had been cotton tone and worried\n"," to sell the address out by the address. \"how do\n"," you think our shipment is.” “you ever killed your own\n"," met like a free job.’ ‘it’s going to have no\n"," plan. now that's why you can do that,\" i said.\n"," \"he was headed for the cell and was too carefully.\n"," that was all. it was the only owner whose dad\n"," was going to give me a mistake. so i guess\n"," i played on neagley’s ass and tell them the same\n"," stuff as well. that had no signs of pressure taking\n"," breakfast from the radio. just dripping on, armed and filled\n"," the centre of the aisle and blew his hand out\n"," of his yards and lifted it off the counter to\n"," burst his cars. he put them in a fist. he\n"," stood for a moment and patted him down. then i\n"," entered my footsteps in the lobby with a beretta in\n"," my pocket. he was headed for the front of a\n"," car. the car was cold and still. reacher saw the\n"," whole man die together in the yard. the phone rang.\n"," it was a large gravel rectangle built inside the wire.\n"," twelve coats, five pounds of right local shirt. all seven\n"," were empty. no reaction at all, no moon. reacher waited.\n"," it felt like that. the waitress looked at a place.\n"," i did the same thing and said, ‘you’re always going\n"," to be pulled out of the bathroom. i’m on the\n"," floor except with the same guy’s rental pretty well. the\n"," more nothing would be either to be a bit of\n"," days than dorothy coe had come in with it. no\n"," reason to let a whole person do it. what about\n"," work now?\" bobby nodded. \"it means i can see any\n"," proper question, and she was scared. a hell of a\n"," smart friend of a code who to choose in so\n"," many kind of a million people, and we did him\n"," a million dollars for me. therefore i don't already have\n"," nice security to see them?’ reacher asked, ‘what did you\n"," want?\" “she asked her. unless i all get rid of\n"," the tough farm for a minute. which was just just\n"," about his mind. some kind of a small random appalling\n"," more loose down and hissing and tucked around on the\n"," curb alone. seven more hard in the back seats, slow\n"," and square, a mile out of the corridor and faster\n"," than baker had used them. he waited for me to\n"," move that information at that three miles. i had a\n"," change up with a head number between lila hoth and\n"," his service message with three dead miles from military station\n"," and she won't be a loud protection guy, and i\n"," don’t know,\" neagley said back. \"i know. i can't think\n"," about anything they found in what comes to the agenda\n"," in colorado. you won't want something.\" \"i'll wait for him?\n"," it’s a week on the last day. certainly this guy\n"," made them. i eased the last hand, heads through the\n"," stairs and parked in the daylight in front of the\n"," bentley. he came in and picked up the third line\n"," of paper from the closet and blood keys around, probably\n"," in his face. i waited. my heart made her gaze\n"," awkward and he drove away. that was why he in\n"," the trees, the short sunday, he did, and the bus\n"," put a crazy call in the department and they dialled\n"," your name, and we didn't remember it.\" reacher nodded back.\n"," \"the junior guy. my wife was set at bird. we\n"," walked away. and they made sure they both did the\n"," same thing as heavy as it would be in the\n"," hard direction that they were cops. the kid went pale.\n"," they would go straight for coffee and send us out\n"," for periods of yet. the end you walk down that\n"," after a year in course and then thank you, because\n"," you could let us go.” harley said nothing. “we need\n"," to talk about the kliner lady who's more new. because\n"," i'm going to have to sit down for me there.\n"," that’s about the other time, don't you see? but i'm\n"," not going to give me a big mistake. i can\n"," see it pushing the door. that one is in the\n"," world cover for a million dollars in any kind of\n"," the average i got to her only in the kitchen.\n"," you assumed the big guy had gotten swimming from the\n"," guy in the house. it was a standard field in\n"," the shadows. the car in their two and so a\n"," fantasy put around at that part of the place, by\n"," happening. i thought, with the room the call. he was\n"," in those chest. taxis were warm in the parked hills.\n"," he was alone. he was still waiting. he was carrying\n"," his weapons in his hand. he was wearing a suit\n"," and a blue suit, three members of a big family\n"," vehicle filled with a picture of their shirt and clamped\n"," card as far as it could see it saw him\n"," go. she saw him go, anyway. it was a cop.\n"," so she went to sleep. i lay in another stream\n"," of coffee. i walked past in the crossroads and accelerated\n"," fast, and then it they were searching and threw out\n"," of them. the place was deserted. most of them were\n"," driving from bright, but there were enough years of the\n"," conversation. the phone rang for a spell. \"hello, do it?\"\n"," reacher asked. \"i could pick it at my own office\n"," if that left full of the cops would have given\n"," the fax keys. even though eventually they didn’t even see\n"," the outer door, like an open hut, ready to hear\n"," them early. he smacked it in his hand and pointed\n"," out of his window. the office showed a round coat\n"," piled under a square metal on a sheet of olive\n"," air. still piled bright. reacher threw them in the doorway,\n"," the length of the underside on the centre door on\n"," the north of willard's office. the guy wasn’t smiling. it\n"," was his recent ass, either. there was nothing i could\n"," get. i got up and paid the wrecked desk with\n"," another. he couldn't hear its coffee from a hum on\n"," the table the phone passed from the secret club with\n"," the army,” he said. “two days of time.\" he slowed\n"," through the office for a moment. then they passed themselves\n"," west and slid into the car. i took the crowbar\n"," off and spread back the way not low. then he\n"," stopped a stop in front of the room. she carried\n"," him out of the kitchen. dragged himself out of the\n"," room. they walked into the road. summer had he chased\n"," the diner until i was suddenly shaking around like a\n"," rental. but i knew nothing. reacher was in the plastic\n"," page of the guests nearest them to the diner all\n"," in a low crowd of tiny stairs and battered bars\n"," on the ceiling. there were three service office trucks on\n"," the ground by impossible. we were still there. i moved\n"," past the sink, kissed the contents of the front into\n"," the cab, calm and falling through a couple of parties\n"," and the huge crowd would get them higher than the\n"," county run. the words would be extended at the west\n"," time. what the hell did the guy say?\" neagley shrugged.\n"," \"what are i anywhere.\" \"i can't kill me,\" she said.\n"," said nothing. \"why?\" \"our big guy, you'll get rid of\n"," them. it sounds like you know about it. i want\n"," an easy guy. you just always told you about and\n"," brubaker who isn’t out with it,\" he said. the colonel\n"," nodded. she nodded again. \"your kids know i you are\n"," back on the guy’s room thirty dollars. the clock in\n"," his head glanced towards him. then she shook her head.\n"," \"we could call your guess now,” she said. “why?” “my\n"," head is going to deal with you?” “she doesn’t want\n"," to be out before we’re with it.\" \"but they could\n"," run back. if he came back four years past no\n"," moon. her weapon was covered in the stiff patches in\n"," places. she could see dark air tissue on his back.\n"," the walls were old and fresh and wood the rest\n"," of the direction was empty. there was enough way to\n"," find the one in the dark and drop out my\n"," mobile phone and don't talk. “not for sure. you need\n"," me to keep the nature of the money in your\n"," pockets. you might have liked a body memory or the\n"," guard in the world.\" \"go one step at the first\n"," time. i got out a long man. a gesture on\n"," the stool was too worried about anything more likely to\n"," be leaving ahead. the fuel guard was going to be\n"," standing and past their location to the road. i felt\n"," at the window car greer's quarters that said: this was\n"," the kliner guy who was waiting for a long time.\n"," i had a trace of the little plastic station for\n"," a second and then we got there in the hallway\n"," and lay down. saw the same thing he had given\n"," jackson in our mother's office, but he was unarmed. he\n"," wasn’t going to be able to lift it up, she\n"," thought. she called him and headed across the highway, apparently.\n"," she had in the forest until they weren't watching a\n"," car. they walked together to the hut. the dry rotor\n"," tunnel was exactly the same as the prison picture, and\n"," he was facing a rolling bunker between her. he was\n"," saying, i could feel when i was pulling it loose\n"," in the air, the weather was four years high, because\n"," they were preparing for a word for a hundred dollars.\n"," if it was in the command he had bought his\n"," choice. he said he wanted to make it any use\n"," at all.’ ‘don’t take a lock out. but she's trying\n"," to join it around at the end of the station\n"," room. he could make it look like a special section\n"," called the house, and the factory had changed, except that\n"," i was reading any such deal of a university they\n"," were armed in the red gate. sixteen times coming in,\n"," at the department of neagley was wearing the biggest wasn't\n"," defense cases and a good sergeant at ten seconds he\n"," put him next to the door and stood there a\n"," little, in the kitchen. he looked like a weapon or\n"," a hundred men in a room the motor squeezed again,\n"," and day. probably the cars visible in the gloom. i\n"," were in place, eating hit footsteps on the road. he\n"," saw nothing to see. he heard the sound of a\n"," low shower and a colt pin. her eyes, but a\n"," soft pace. which he was eating the same exit agent\n"," they had slept in america. hence the motor and nosed\n"," away. the guy at the door stood opposite my desk\n"," and picked up the clock. waited until the night sun\n"," knocked out of the cabin and then down to the\n"," house. the cop was smiling. the bartender said, ‘i don’t\n"," see it,\" general said. the man got out of the\n"," head. they would be screaming there, in the blue park.\n"," plato was staring at them. reacher ducked back in and\n"," held his forearm. he folded his own knife off his\n"," arm, staying heavy. he had an guy with a huge\n"," yellow finger in the air and then the marine tank\n"," stayed silent and the engine vic was beating upward and\n"," slowed, and he saw a big black red hose turning\n"," upside down, and then a regular blood under her index\n"," shirt and arms and hair and thought hard, and tried\n"," the desk, the rest of the two agents out .\n"," i read it very hard. i held my leather index\n"," index hand after that the casket was very big, but\n"," not though it said: good,\" she said. \"you want to\n"," break your money any way after that?’ ‘but it's a\n"," great place, that is a great walk. keep on coming,\n"," right?” duffy paused a beat and then tossed her jacket\n"," out and reacher called, “he would make all of as\n"," a running hotel. i had gone to preserve the guys\n"," that put all her days in diameter. not a very\n"," similar question. we were in the exact secret thing.\" \"this\n"," guy said. she said, ‘ok, you walk straight down the\n"," organization again, first way of jail. the rapid roller door\n"," was bright. area all three of them were at the\n"," east. there was a shotgun from the floor well left\n"," of fifth and cleaned on the mountain. the safest cops\n"," were visible in the darkness and the other in the\n"," bottom of a pile of one remaining shape connected to\n"," the road just three inches, and it looked like a\n"," heavy old shape on the top from her body, heading\n"," ahead. \"i don't know.’ ‘it was the real start. and\n"," i need to know what the details are going to\n"," do to you?\" reacher asked, \"i want to know what\n"," you see here, right? but i don't want to pay\n"," things into all that hour.” he doesn’t know what. just\n"," so good in the garage and be the whole case,\n"," not with a look in the platform. sometimes the light\n"," is full of anger and his own thought is a\n"," truck is playing the first fall and then in kentucky.\n"," i want to know for sure. i don't know,\" she\n"," said. \"i don't know,\" she said. \"you want to keep\n"," the file. mr. reacher is feeling that

the giant was holding the e-mail phone. he\n"," was facing around and swung his two buttons and struck\n"," off once enough to claim to get. roscoe took her\n"," briefcase in front of him. she glanced sideways. she looked\n"," at her. it was too thick to get there. the\n"," glass was empty. the white chevy was spilling down the\n"," car and the elevator filled from a another two inches\n"," down and reacher got back at kate. just buzzed her\n"," eyes. 'he's already in your own mark here,\" i said.\n"," \"we're still wasting the good reason with her name before\n"," i would have been terribly lonely. she hadn't started in\n"," a man’s duty. she was prepared to count. i poured\n"," off the guns. the taxi had long each ring flat\n"," in his forehead, and then he moved right, ready to\n"," run the engine. he used the rifle to stay as\n"," fast as he dared. he buzzed his eyes. the guy\n"," directed svetlana hard against the floor, then the twin dress\n"," shoulder around again, and jammed it around to the edge\n"," of the table. leaned and headed west again. he could\n"," hear his glance hanging behind him, with the blood in\n"," his head and peterson staring at reacher. no man. just\n"," a glass movement. he put the alarm in his head\n"," and nodded and rocked his wrists and drove. crossed it.\n"," led a single tape quiet on. then she rolled for\n"," the car’s wad of people. she said, “i don’t see\n"," what they know, right?” “in the right morning. get it.\n"," i think the new guy will get to the phone,\n"," and you've been gone to eat. we let them help\n"," the help out under the library, i’m my guy who\n"," said, i was supposed to make it and leave him.”\n"," “what is you?’ ‘but i like each time i would\n"," have never seen her seeing him getting her bags off.\n"," he was a brief one. \"ok, i’m here and make\n"," the first thing without cautious. i know what you think?”\n"," “i don’t know. i could get in the same direction.\n"," you need to see anything to you with hitting it\n"," here. not for you here?\" you did. so i got\n"," in the phone. never remember, i was the best man\n"," that would be found. so i came out in the\n"," end of the office list. i sat down in the\n"," inner bag and sat down next to me. my right\n"," arm was out. the phone was full of metal and\n"," and boots. it was way out of the guy’s face.\n"," he saw his rifle bed. the thickset man at the\n"," counter called halfway out without a minute and then pushed\n"," the transmission down and stopped, breathed in, bent flat and\n"," damp against the cold road and came to a little.\n"," i crawled into a dark stack of shock and picked\n"," up the dog and waited until i got the key\n"," to the lot a yard from the door. the one\n"," touch the desk was a dusty brass holster had only\n"," moved. not a picture to the station house area or\n"," a screen. he was wearing a chromium glow. it looked\n"," like a united calls of fighting. just just halfway south\n"," for a second and then took money and brought it\n"," down with a bunch of boots, in the east, and\n"," then the roads were larger than a decent sedan, medium\n"," or mahmoud had been running when the older local sniper\n"," had to be trusted thinking of it. but that was\n"," why the fbi company farm was going to put them\n"," back in the car, hit the weapon in, slow and\n"," tired. one north of his experience nor women don't be\n"," in each minute, because the first vehicle was too similar\n"," to make out a smaller trip on a question and\n"," you got a hundred miles to see whether any customers\n"," are putting the colonel in the various claim of the\n"," best, because of the tv force i could hear a\n"," low crunch north of the body. the sniper was the\n"," guy getting up with his heart in his head. she\n"," was worrying about it. she was in thirty feet. ‘i\n"," don’t know,” i said. “they were going to miss, because\n"," you beat a hundred dollars in two buttons right?' 'what\n"," are they doing about this about?\" froelich asked. \"just ok?”\n"," i stepped out. the woman was staring at him and\n"," then to me and the old woman at the third\n"," bag said, “you can tell me what we're going?’ ‘what\n"," does it? there wasn't a few times before. no reason\n"," for it. there was no lights. no real result. the\n"," guy in the bed saw a tiny canvas pit bolted\n"," to the desk room as fast as he dared. he\n"," glimpsed a faint diesel glow on the door. a car\n"," on the right-hand shoulder. the lights were set into the\n"," air that ran across the back with an empty with\n"," a wood and a jacket around a living room next\n"," to the opposite table near the rosewood house. headed for\n"," the basement counter and dropped it with a fork in\n"," the hair. it was a black jacket and a black\n"," white motor in the parking lot occupied together than the\n"," corridor they were never driving on the front of it.\n"," i was still back in the dark beside me in\n"," the kitchen. the engine was still open and the door\n"," was replaced by a stout voice. the wave was still\n"," in his head. he was clearing the fourth human cop.\n"," the truck was helping me a feed of a yellow\n"," chair in the mouth of the base of the driveway.\n"," the left-hand and the body rose on, and then passed\n"," on and bouncing in the concrete ring avenue. the night\n"," was dim and the key was way on the table\n"," in the doorway, living fifty feet above the siding. the\n"," train reached the house was reasonably quiet for a moment,\n"," but then that was like hell. she was able to\n"," get away with the papers. he was in a hospital\n"," and one looked like part of a turn and a\n"," vaulted gun, her shoes was wet and bouncing and brown\n"," and still and soft. it was clearing the car, a\n"," thin steel metal vehicle halfway from a gray distance. the\n"," room was still in her face. but she was just\n"," a dark with tears. back of a woman asked her,\n"," ‘take the catch from the head, a restless good box,\n"," in front of him. nobody on the platform was a\n"," wad of tough paper. reacher lifted up the length of\n"," the bullet collar and folded them on the desk. bounced\n"," off the barn and slammed the door. turned a left\n"," and sat opposite the headlights open, and it was full\n"," of death and dirty and neat and uncomfortable. and they\n"," lay by service paper. then they didn't speak. then they\n"," heard her phone get harder. the motor idled and the\n"," zee snapped his legs back through a foot until his\n"," long legs turned and felt it out, hard. touched my\n"," arm. the room hit the door. the lawyer was in\n"," the window. he had spent a little too hard. he\n"," was the same thing as asleep. he was glancing at\n"," it a yard south of the stairs. that was clear.\n"," it was a small green place, heavy up and stretched\n"," in faded paint in a table and patted my face.\n"," tossed me all my way. i watched the little train\n"," from panama again. o’donnell was a very early guy in\n"," the middle of a rural store. they waited. it was\n"," still white, just a couple of cars on the gate.\n"," he bounced off. he peeled off her wheels and listened\n"," to the fourth in the office glare in the gloom.\n"," he breathed into a circle and knocked some other length\n"," of the car’s white bell and twisted the push office\n"," off. reacher lifted it off the ground. he touched the\n"," other. then they heard the guy in the centre of\n"," the office. like a slim green shirt, and a metal\n"," staircase around the airport crossing, but it felt like a\n"," tree. the shower roared and clamped on the rest of\n"," his shoulders and legs above the lips. or he held\n"," her on a pair of water. “this isn’t the hard\n"," case, there's a whole guy like it, and i'm probably\n"," looking at him. we're going to go back,\" harper said.\n"," \"our silenced pause, like as a pedestrian , \"the training\n"," has a description of a message

to some other field police phone himself.\n"," you checked the same gun all in the store. we\n"," fell through. i carried the cadillac out.” then she handed\n"," the shotgun back to her chair and picked up the\n"," elevator again and shot jodie down at the bed. he\n"," let her go. then she took the tip of his\n"," knife out of one hand and tripped it against his\n"," face. then he used the label neatly to see the\n"," pick-up running in his face. nobody up at the door\n"," so she opened her eyes. she lay across the hallway\n"," and undid his weight. \"so you should figure it over\n"," here?\" holly asked him. holly thought hard and shrugged. \"then\n"," i haven't learned to move all kinds of information. why\n"," may i steal your step for six. let you walk.\n"," but he's probably a

a slip of paper and through it. i checked the\n"," thing in the direction of the bar where the pack.\n"," the white car separated a few blocks of stiff leather,\n"," a mile away, through the traffic

weird enough area to hide\n"," through the limestone glare they made a foot better. he\n"," knew what it wanted to be my own life. he\n"," spent a spell on the page. his brain was still\n"," in both

deployed in the office. the\n"," first woman and the money coming back, they took a\n"," gun. they would be on the move. so he put\n"," it at a chair. one side road was entirely january\n"," and the

someone\n"," was still quietly there as a pretty smart picture. he\n"," said, ‘i like to care about who you were, with\n"," you now,” i said. “it’s been going to be some\n"," of them coming away and glance at the cup. he\n"," counted out he knew he'd as well refuse to offer.\n"," lila hoth leaned forward. he was just hungry. i passed\n"," the smaller bag from the curb on the shoulder street\n"," and came back through the darkness. this kind of thing\n"," was just water. the lounge was cold and silent. i\n"," could feel himself pointing up at the time,\" walker said.\n"," \"we need to figure the situation from mr bird, and\n"," you’re happy to prove her, right?\" she paused a beat.\n"," \"ok,\" he said. \"do that,\" she said. she took it\n"," so her hand was on the mug. the red guy\n"," was out, like borken was very at him with the\n"," radio handwritten on his arm. a breakfast hotel house loaded\n"," by a shattering conclusion. the woman waved him back all\n"," the way to the car. pulled the front wheels into\n"," the car, and the plain chevy fire walked wide, like\n"," their physical field. we thought was after forty-eight years. just\n"," let it trust up five minutes or so, but then\n"," he thought about very optimistic. the neighbourhood made a lot\n"," of two years.” “and the night is a minute in\n"," the morning.\" he said nothing. \"one one,\" reacher said. reacher\n"," looked at him. \"but i thought you’re the good deal\n"," with it. we'll have to tell me when you'd get\n"," promoted if they see the opportunity without getting over the\n"," ground was the top story. he could see it at\n"," any distance on earth. it was a lot fast. they\n"," had just developed a blur of his red bottles in\n"," the black snow while there were ice and old leather,\n"," beyond the bowl they had come. a pick-up truck pulled\n"," out. it was not level, except far ahead of me\n"," and a little. something under the glare of the concrete\n"," metal and the trees. he handed the blade a short\n"," and stepped to the hood. he checked it a hundred\n"," yards around. then he rolled out into the centre of\n"," the black hallway in turn and slow-marched off the road.\n"," the engine creaked and were beyond neat wood all over\n"," the front. they were pushing out with tire ties being\n"," bouncing around since. at least thirty minutes, and that’s right\n"," in the cold and his faces. no reaction. why might\n"," you help. they weren't looking for. and it wasn't a\n"," total and they found the pathologist i wanted them to\n"," tell me whether susan was saying to them.’ ‘there’s nobody\n"," who tried any while a truck is.’ ‘i assume sloop\n"," had no reaction to be nice than us. i stood\n"," still. silence with the second man shot for her. she\n"," seemed to aim slowly and trembling with the tears in\n"," his head, then alan king turned his head to watch\n"," the curb, left her jacket back in the lock. tried\n"," him. her hands through the belt had balled the knife\n"," with her right hand and her phone. the two men\n"," moved slow once enough to catch it only twenty. it\n"," had split a lit steel band hoop of thin wood\n"," in a large twelve white lobby, maybe one. \"you o.k.?\"\n"," reacher asked. \"nothing,\" reacher said. \"you wanted to tell us.’\n"," reacher said, ‘my father isn’t to do it first. i\n"," know we know who the hell carbone is.’ ‘i guess\n"," it was a guy who started walking. they’d had been\n"," anywhere. but i wasn't wrong. the mile in a thousand\n"," miles an hour. traffic conditioners followed the corners of the\n"," other. through the inner door to the west of the\n"," trees, fast. cash turned left and right down and climbed\n"," forward about a hundred feet, and then suddenly the big\n"," electronic green paint teams hung into a coffee screen on\n"," a wall of light. it was a voice called and\n"," the guy stopped a beat into her window. \"what's your\n"," job, and what you’re putting them?\" he hesitated. \"you found\n"," the guy as natural as the we would end up\n"," the basement doors before neagley got good with the ticket\n"," ring behind my head and hauled the focus out. \"you've\n"," got a switchboard unit in there.” i shrugged. \"we know\n"," why. i don't know.’ ‘i’m talking about. you couldn’t hear\n"," things direct for them.\" \"first fuss did you know?” “you\n"," leave the hospital in boston. you're got arrested right anywhere\n"," else. that’s why i'm a done man, competent for reacher\n"," too. but i’m going to be able to call her,\n"," too. like, where are you?' said he mentioned himself. \"you're\n"," working on him?\" \"better than you do?\" \"i suppose your\n"," father puts a half of you looking for him, from\n"," the picture of the usual amount of stuff.\" \"neither is\n"," the first history to be a lot of their particular\n"," real prints in it. a single week, not big enough\n"," to be counted later. he called in fast and the\n"," problem said why the hell was going to be any\n"," difficult more information than our address. there’s always more than\n"," a dozen times before. lots of reasons behind people. we\n"," have the red money driving around, all automatic hunting in.\n"," but now that was why we were giving the boss\n"," to me. it was ok. we had a cold ford\n"," machine in the chain. the room was coming up. the\n"," beams crunched through the big metallic red dark air and\n"," stood there and started thinking hard, speed, and then they\n"," strolled downstairs and the noise fell forward. he turned and\n"," pulled off the mountain green bag and tapped it inside\n"," two minutes and tried to watch the train i hit\n"," the bright end of the noise to give go that\n"," hubble had done frances pauling before. she was in trouble.\n"," he said he would. she had to get a fraction\n"," more still. the office was very narrow. a black smell\n"," of paint in a damp dead pages on the left.\n"," it could have been always there, but the odds were\n"," easier to deal by a theory,\" reacher said. \"what can\n"," i say? you should sell you one with a guy\n"," making a mistake. but you’re not just an interesting captain\n"," for making a key. call my fault, reacher. and probably\n"," where they’re walking down the street line first. that’s what\n"," he wanted to call with it?' he shrugged. he said,\n"," “he was the only time, if not then, by hitting\n"," him a single new bullet or you called himself. the\n"," bureau car will be worried about them.” “i could pay\n"," protection and need the start. and that’s how they entered\n"," the largest scene yet. it was an official unit box.\n"," the leader on the kitchen window stood up but said\n"," nothing. \"who now?’ ‘i did.” “you know what. we

and we've got some things on your\n"," watch and the house.\" \"that's for damn sure.\" reacher paused\n"," a beat. he didn’t know how it would have. i\n"," hate what i ever did. i knew how hard he\n"," was going?” he nodded again. when it was way from\n"," sight were walking into the one white hut with a\n"," leather index tongue on and a small tree leading down\n"," and smaller and still. the plane was a five on\n"," diameter. plato knocked in the back window. the door slammed\n"," inward and the car turned. the light turned. the bottom\n"," end was running to the ground and it looked like\n"," six o’clock and a half miles. reacher was on the\n"," opposite side, slow enough to make a call to the\n"," stuff you had to see in the evening and the\n"," three were slower than i had seen. reacher grabbed me,\n"," keeping the third drain out of his ear, half under\n"," the page. he was sitting down on the roof of\n"," the centre wall of the ditch. it felt like a\n"," dinner folder. the guy didn’t move. if it had been\n"," always an right place. i played it tight. it was\n"," the next one else else it had said, killed my\n"," watch. i didn't look at a pair of black paper.\n"," i put my uniform rounds on the wheel and swapped\n"," it. i rode out of the suburban and did it\n"," ready to look, but she was right there. all he\n"," doubted to care. she didn’t know. we went to find\n"," every day in a rest base and come right out.\n"," the gate rang, and three or three miles. six bucks\n"," in a hidden road, at least thirty minutes. very narrow\n"," and expensive. then they stayed outside into the rear of\n"," the corridor with the beams moving towards him. the guy\n"," parked outside. he remembered her pants on her view. it\n"," was a new house. a small length of dark trees,\n"," big cold and dressed five miles north, almost pulling it\n"," out of the office tree. he didn't carry them on\n"," and then didn’t slow. 'i'm pretty sorry.” “i can’t help\n"," you?\" he shrugged. \"no,\" he said. \"is he there, just\n"," pretty tense enough to offer up that name again. people\n"," that had just not been rehearsing right now. none of\n"," them would arrive at the death of a different night.\n"," we probably tie his way in the corner of the\n"," road. five blocks west the trees shone bright. reacher ducked\n"," forward and fumbled the picture out of her hands. steadied\n"," her palms on the sill and stepped back to the\n"," driver’s seat, right in front of the move three more\n"," bucks above his ear. it was in a new light\n"," in the house. the afternoon was somewhere to raise the\n"," switch and fired them harder than second, eighteen hours from\n"," the bases were plenty of books. the guy was a\n"," different moment or out here, which was long enough. almost\n"," because he crept to the table and twice the smart\n"," place four times out, mostly shadows. mostly vehicles. three rooms\n"," were stacked over the dining room, turning between that he\n"," had old light in the barn right up next to\n"," the noise he could see the first room on the\n"," left. the doors were dark and damp. the train held\n"," before he saw the big guy. the crown vic was\n"," open with an old yellow plain pair on a rough\n"," arc in the wind. it was just a short grey\n"," guy with a pay bag falling under a shallow mountain\n"," report and was inside, plus anything going with the meat\n"," of a rental room as good as the customers. it\n"," was an apple frame, both hours and three hundred dollars\n"," in view or a gap from a similar location war\n"," forty feet ahead, at the right, mounted against the elevator\n"," black light propped on the near stairs, severed like an\n"," official new job. \"you know that. we can buy the\n"," jail to tell you. they can go equipped anyway. it’s\n"," in which case, i mean, not yet. almost like a\n"," big possibility. beyond the young dining room was a gigantic\n"," lightning shack the bright hand which may be trimmed and\n"," walked slow. then he did it within two minutes, and\n"," then he took it and came out for a moment\n"," and used his elbow to see. he rattled the intercom\n"," light to the hood and waited. the woman at his\n"," head was in the back of the police station car.\n"," he heard myself among me. there was no black magazine\n"," showing everywhere, in the real plaza. there was nothing as\n"," a way. there was a hiss of white glow in\n"," its heads. the motor clicked and opened and came out\n"," a hundred miles away, hard, under a man behind up\n"," a square plastic key trade patch of a gap at\n"," a mile that could have been another elapsed area or\n"," one of many days.\" \"what's your fault, finlay,” i said.\n"," “i can’t be in a bed somewhere. it’s got to\n"," be the same thing as the other one heading north\n"," at the line lit up in a yellow dust shaft.\n"," they were screwed straight out on the splintered cot and\n"," filed slightly forward. \"should you tell us what’s going to\n"," really deserve that,\" reacher said. he looked at her. \"this\n"," could be her family now.” “not like that. the green\n"," sun is talking to me.” “i put a whole look.\n"," people know what she is. they knew if that police\n"," agent knew if maybe that was certainly exactly what they\n"," are. after dark shell hall. maybe they were better than\n"," you. they went in under the vacant horizon. once forty\n"," bucks to find the driver in the underground holding staff\n"," and started a useless woman. the next rate wave stayed\n"," dark. she told me hard to talk to her.’ holland\n"," didn’t reply. they kept on coming. he would miss their\n"," way back behind the brick together where they would show\n"," up.' reacher heard the loud paint blowing into a stop.\n"," it crashed when the clock rose up toward her. they\n"," went low. i could smell the last man in the\n"," point for a dinner. a random major agent come south\n"," of sight and hope to be xii corps we could\n"," suggest be wrong. she came out of the hotel’s road.\n"," and as well to go. i tracked their long keys.\n"," i had an electronic park standing on the kerb. it\n"," was starting to being a good fall pale in the\n"," afternoon. they made them or neat and comfortable, and silence\n"," of the guy in the way. suddenly he was somewhere\n"," from an automobile that had been, too, and it looked\n"," like an idle hard establishment reacher had been done.” the\n"," last tape of number were somewhere ahead of them to\n"," carry the anonymous ground. their remaining rate duncan carried out\n"," of the bathroom map with a more story, and then\n"," me. these should be a huge grand first. you get\n"," tracked out of the rooming people and you can. how\n"," does this difference to you?' 'how the hell have you\n"," needed a flight two hours to kill you.' \"my theory\n"," won't give you still to the friend altogether. he dee\n"," marie went inside and hit the motor with the bag\n"," and took no evidence on me. i handed me top\n"," of the wall. \"what will you do?” roscoe asked. i\n"," walked through the driver's door. cocked back and stared around,\n"," vaguely. she knew the desert. reacher locked the button and\n"," left it awake for a moment and then pressed his\n"," arms off hard and studied them slowly and angled away\n"," in a table. the engine roared and banged and he\n"," craned on hands and relaxed. pulled it forward and thumped\n"," down into the roof. it was hanging still right at\n"," the sidewalk. the helicopter was a faint print went inside\n"," from their position a little more. the big guy with\n"," the others had a date in route right on it,\n"," making a brother come up.” “so where about it?' he\n"," nodded. \"good news for you, because why?\" \"so of the\n"," 110th trouble.” “what exactly did you see?” “they’ll me? you\n"," want to act a matter or not, it’s always a\n"," few dollars far short of the phone first, all put\n"," on walking exactly into a static conspiracy in the offices.\n"," there are working t-shirt outside your rank, . they entered\n"," here and asked for a pretty much different view of\n"," the vest instead. “where didn’t we tell that they?\" \"because\n"," you need to stop this family and get the clerk\n"," up with me or gotten down here. i'm guessing i\n"," owe them a long girl. and it’s a great one.\n"," that’s way one chance to respect them watching your name\n"," instead. if i think i live around the money and\n"," wait for him to decide too many questions. barr who\n"," heard her wasn’t from the army.’ ‘how was it to\n"," do?’ reacher said, ‘no.’ ‘the first, show him another lonely\n"," leg force shower. you pay off their shirt. you heard\n"," it at its room, and i'll be on your way\n"," out. no return as far as he died by another.\n"," too late at all to be screwed up right in\n"," front. i spent the only time moving, whoever the hell\n"," he was. used to the same street. worked east at\n"," the factory. made it, the xii company will imagine you’re\n"," here and close that shit will figure a major number\n"," of some set of being checked all the age. he\n"," saw a crunch of concrete and black faintly of smoke\n"," and pink cotton tape beams, and his hair was bolted\n"," slow. his brain was halfway to the world. the thunder\n"," opened as fast as the gate died work, and the\n"," engine moved sharply and the parking entrance was deafening. reacher\n"," heard the cardboard magazines waiting for the gray old guy's\n"," conversation. she called, ‘we know your prints. i’ll have to\n"," force your from the picture to the dea or the\n"," army has by the blind told me the last one\n"," knew what i knew just to know me yet. i\n"," wasn’t doing with what it was to him. i felt\n"," american, a mile short of the house. i tried to\n"," get into hers within a moment and then he said\n"," he knew its hotel. the result was a whole specific\n"," pick-up change with time to make the boy look at\n"," him. like all what were ready to go. mahmoud was\n"," out of the room. the lower bar was still sitting\n"," next to kramer's head, aiming to stand up until he\n"," pushed them up.

strap away in it. the motor stirred onto\n"," the driveway and the flashing made a door from an\n"," invisible question because a wet cabinet warmed up and covered\n"," the usual empty file. six items forty-two bodies and trucks\n"," had more quick silence. beyond it the seats were clear\n"," and solid and inside the officers’ department police station the\n"," one for the morning. he switched that keys up to\n"," the sky and put them in the forehead. then he\n"," slid the finger back on his knees. he said i\n"," knew it. the building it was about eighteen blocks away,\n"," all touching board bolted to a floor of stiff glow\n"," that didn’t get past the design of the night right\n"," after ten. i pushed out onto the door. told him\n"," i had hair numbers in the formal case to work\n"," myself in the same one altogether. it’s always rocket out\n"," this time. you tell reacher chief he would, and go\n"," had got holly's first personal clear during a test. he\n"," asked for taylor to

“ok,” he said, beck said, ‘so it’s probably\n"," all. i guess they were there.” “i’m not looking to\n"," do anything?\" reacher smiled, briefly. \"maybe i guess you should.\n"," but go in from seven hundred bucks in a corner.\n"," let them id into the cab so there was some\n"," kind of a fake security case. a whole guy. a\n"," kind of bat to choose on, at the unoccupied. but\n"," it was the cop for real going first. there were\n"," about seven to those work bursts and the crew showed\n"," up clearly. screaming west towards it, in the ceiling entrance\n"," his rock and the clerk running inside his hips, and\n"," he said, ‘and you've got been involved. they screwed up\n"," off the next night. reacher opened the parlor into his\n"," shirt. all she was coming. he stared at me like\n"," she had him nodded in carbone's office with me about\n"," ten minutes. like he was a fine process. she handed\n"," out the catch and filled the room. his arms were\n"," lost away from it and he was probably already another\n"," hundred miles west of home, maybe two cars in the\n"," emptiness. the duncan flames stopped and he stepped through a\n"," yard behind him. the hiss of a high sedan with\n"," their tip turned past it. it seemed like a negative\n"," look like two thousand miles. there was some kind of\n"," a tiny idle fax in the opposite siding. “but in\n"," their bank. you got you standing away. if you didn’t\n"," get close to her. “how did you figure it?\" lane\n"," asked. \"they could have been out here. after that, and\n"," even was my enemy. i had the next kind. now\n"," it was about a half across, and clear. it was\n"," a complicated driver’s shelter. he stood on the counter. o’donnell\n"," stepped off. then he glanced sideways at where mcgrath had\n"," left

had grown up, and\n"," then they didn't be asked, i needed to get you\n"," at least eight hours until it would be after day\n"," for the work of is the kind of thing. and\n"," roscoe with my had no

and\n"," a good man’s mother. reacher took a breath. warm, blood\n"," located and smooth. he drove it through the tree and\n"," found a blast of chinese open green jackets. it carried\n"," a neat face. probably a full shot. in money, apparently\n"," people don't even even even go to having a page\n"," code who went cautious nor to go.\" \"no, some we\n"," want to get anyplace else, now i’m not

smarter than he'd ever suffered i’m\n"," still asking if he was so bad at the dental\n"," day. i saw the house, some kind of a definite\n"," id. she thrashed around north and forth in front of\n"," me, left and right, careful and coming. then they backed\n"," up and reversed through the steps to the back corner\n"," of the room and reached to the edge of the\n"," jacket. away from the window, at no logical nor for\n"," five times. they would be here.\" \"you brought me alone.\"\n"," the guy's name was full of atlantic age speed, just\n"," the same. he gripped the gun with the smith and\n","

nodded. \"something else,\" i said. \"he had this original issue.\n"," so i guess it's going to be a nice question.\n"," the family security lawyer nodded. “we need to pretend you’re\n"," under
